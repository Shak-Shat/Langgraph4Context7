# Why LangGraph?

## Overview
LangGraph provides essential infrastructure for building LLM-powered applications, supporting both structured workflows and autonomous agents without abstracting away prompts or architecture, giving developers fine-grained control while handling the complexity of state management.

## Key Concepts
- Supports both scaffolded workflows and autonomous agent architectures
- Provides low-level infrastructure rather than high-level abstractions
- Maintains state persistence for complex conversational applications
- Enables streaming of both events and LLM tokens during execution
- Facilitates debugging, testing and deployment through dedicated platform tools

## Prerequisites
None - LangGraph is a framework that can be added to any LLM application.

## Implementation
LangGraph offers three primary capabilities that benefit LLM application developers:

### 1. Persistence Layer
```python
# Example of persistent state in a graph
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Create a graph with persistence
builder = StateGraph(MyState)
# Add nodes and edges
# ...
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())

# State is automatically persisted between runs
thread_id = "user-123"
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}
result = graph.invoke(input_data, config)

# Later, can resume from the same state
new_result = graph.invoke(new_input, config)
```

### 2. Streaming Support
```python
# Example of streaming in a graph
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(MyState)
# Add nodes and edges
# ...
graph = builder.compile()

# Stream execution events and LLM tokens
for chunk in graph.stream(input_data):
    # Process streaming chunks
    print(chunk)
```

### 3. Debugging and Deployment
```python
# LangGraph integrates with LangSmith for tracing
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

# Creates traces that can be viewed in LangSmith UI
result = graph.invoke(input_data)

# Can also be deployed via LangGraph Platform
# or as a RESTful service with the LangGraph Server
```

## Benefits
- Eliminates the need to build state management infrastructure from scratch
- Provides human-in-the-loop capabilities through checkpointing
- Enables streaming for responsive user interfaces
- Simplifies debugging of complex multi-step workflows
- Offers flexible deployment options through LangGraph Platform

## Considerations
- Does not provide high-level abstractions or templates
- Requires understanding of application state design
- Developers still need to design and implement prompts
- Best suited for applications with complex state or multi-step reasoning
