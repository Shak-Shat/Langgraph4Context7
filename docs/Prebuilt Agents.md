✨ Contributing Your Library¶

Have you built an awesome open-source library using LangGraph? We'd love to feature your project on the official LangGraph documentation pages! 🏆

To share your project, simply open a Pull Request adding an entry for your package in our packages.yml file.

Guidelines

Your repo must be distributed as an installable package (e.g., PyPI for Python, npm for JavaScript/TypeScript, etc.) 📦
The repo should either use the Graph API (exposing a StateGraph instance) or the Functional API (exposing an entrypoint).
The package must include documentation (e.g., a README.md or docs site) explaining how to use it.

We'll review your contribution and merge it in!

Thanks for contributing! 🚀
