How to add cross-thread persistence (functional API)Â¶

Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Functional API
Persistence
Memory
Chat Models

LangGraph allows you to persist data across different threads. For instance, you can store information about users (their names or preferences) in a shared (cross-thread) memory and reuse them in the new threads (e.g., new conversations).

When using the functional API, you can set it up to store and retrieve memories by using the Store interface:

Create an instance of a Store

from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore, BaseStore



store = InMemoryStore()


Pass the store instance to the entrypoint() decorator and expose store parameter in the function signature:

from langgraph.func import entrypoint



@entrypoint(store=store)

def workflow(inputs: dict, store: BaseStore):

    my_task(inputs).result()

    ...


In this guide, we will show how to construct and use a workflow that has a shared memory implemented using the Store interface.

Note

Support for the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.32.

Support for index and query arguments of the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.54.

Note

If you need to add cross-thread persistence to a StateGraph, check out this how-to guide.

SetupÂ¶

First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys

%%capture --no-stderr

%pip install -U langchain_anthropic langchain_openai langgraph

import getpass

import os





def _set_env(var: str):

    if not os.environ.get(var):

        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")





_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Example: simple chatbot with long-term memoryÂ¶
Define storeÂ¶

In this example we will create a workflow that will be able to retrieve information about a user's preferences. We will do so by defining an InMemoryStore - an object that can store data in memory and query that data.

When storing objects using the Store interface you define two things:

the namespace for the object, a tuple (similar to directories)
the object key (similar to filenames)

In our example, we'll be using ("memories", <user_id>) as namespace and random UUID as key for each new memory.

Importantly, to determine the user, we will be passing user_id via the config keyword argument of the node function.

Let's first define our store!

from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings



in_memory_store = InMemoryStore(

    index={

        "embed": OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small"),

        "dims": 1536,

    }

)


API Reference: OpenAIEmbeddings

Create workflowÂ¶
import uuid



from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

from langgraph.graph import add_messages

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore





model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")





@task

def call_model(messages: list[BaseMessage], memory_store: BaseStore, user_id: str):

    namespace = ("memories", user_id)

    last_message = messages[-1]

    memories = memory_store.search(namespace, query=str(last_message.content))

    info = "\n".join([d.value["data"] for d in memories])

    system_msg = f"You are a helpful assistant talking to the user. User info: {info}"



    # Store new memories if the user asks the model to remember

    if "remember" in last_message.content.lower():

        memory = "User name is Bob"

        memory_store.put(namespace, str(uuid.uuid4()), {"data": memory})



    response = model.invoke([{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}] + messages)

    return response





# NOTE: we're passing the store object here when creating a workflow via entrypoint()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=MemorySaver(), store=in_memory_store)

def workflow(

    inputs: list[BaseMessage],

    *,

    previous: list[BaseMessage],

    config: RunnableConfig,

    store: BaseStore,

):

    user_id = config["configurable"]["user_id"]

    previous = previous or []

    inputs = add_messages(previous, inputs)

    response = call_model(inputs, store, user_id).result()

    return entrypoint.final(value=response, save=add_messages(inputs, response))


API Reference: ChatAnthropic | RunnableConfig | BaseMessage | entrypoint | task | add_messages | MemorySaver

Note

If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass store to the entrypoint decorator, since it's done automatically.

Run the workflow!Â¶

Now let's specify a user ID in the config and tell the model our name:

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "user_id": "1"}}

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Remember: my name is Bob"}

for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):

    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================



Hello Bob! Nice to meet you. I'll remember that your name is Bob. How can I help you today?


config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2", "user_id": "1"}}

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}

for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):

    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================



Your name is Bob.

We can now inspect our in-memory store and verify that we have in fact saved the memories for the user:

for memory in in_memory_store.search(("memories", "1")):

    print(memory.value)

{'data': 'User name is Bob'}

Let's now run the workflow for another user to verify that the memories about the first user are self contained:

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3", "user_id": "2"}}

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}

for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):

    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================



I don't have any information about your name. I can only see our current conversation without any prior context or personal details about you. If you'd like me to know your name, feel free to tell me!
