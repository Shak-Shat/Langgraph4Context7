# ReAct Agent Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive guide to building a custom ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent from scratch using LangGraph, allowing for greater control and customization than using prebuilt agents.

## Key Concepts
- ReAct agents combine reasoning and acting in a loop
- Custom implementation provides more control over agent behavior
- Uses a graph structure with nodes for model calls and tool execution
- Conditional edges determine workflow paths

## Prerequisites
```python
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai
import os
```

## Implementation

### State Definition
```python
from typing import (
    Annotated,
    Sequence,
    TypedDict,
)
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages


class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """The state of the agent."""

    # add_messages is a reducer
    # See https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#reducers
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]
```

### Model and Tools Setup
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though ðŸ˜Š
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini ðŸ˜ˆ."
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"


tools = [get_weather]

model = model.bind_tools(tools)
```

### Nodes and Edges Definition
```python
import json
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}


# Define our tool node
def tool_node(state: AgentState):
    outputs = []
    for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        tool_result = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_call["args"])
        outputs.append(
            ToolMessage(
                content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                name=tool_call["name"],
                tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
            )
        )
    return {"messages": outputs}


# Define the node that calls the model
def call_model(
    state: AgentState,
    config: RunnableConfig,
):
    # this is similar to customizing the create_react_agent with 'prompt' parameter, but is more flexible
    system_prompt = SystemMessage(
        "You are a helpful AI assistant, please respond to the users query to the best of your ability!"
    )
    response = model.invoke([system_prompt] + state["messages"], config)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}


# Define the conditional edge that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state: AgentState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"
```

### Graph Construction
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "tools",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

# Now we can compile and visualize our graph
graph = workflow.compile()
```

## Usage Example
```python
# Helper function for formatting the stream nicely
def print_stream(stream):
    for s in stream:
        message = s["messages"][-1]
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            print(message)
        else:
            message.pretty_print()


inputs = {"messages": [("user", "what is the weather in sf")]}
print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="values"))
```

Example output:
```
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is the weather in sf

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_azW0cQ4XjWWj0IAkWAxq9nLB)
 Call ID: call_azW0cQ4XjWWj0IAkWAxq9nLB
  Args:
    location: San Francisco

=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
Name: get_weather

"It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini ðŸ˜ˆ."

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny! However, it seems there's a playful warning for Geminis. Enjoy the sunshine!
```

## Benefits
- Fine-grained control over agent behavior and logic flow
- Ability to customize each component of the ReAct pattern
- Easy extension with additional nodes for specialized functionality
- Clear separation of model calls and tool execution

## Considerations
- More complex to implement than using prebuilt ReAct agents
- Requires proper error handling for tool calls
- Should customize system prompts for specific use cases
- May need additional nodes for complex agent behaviors
