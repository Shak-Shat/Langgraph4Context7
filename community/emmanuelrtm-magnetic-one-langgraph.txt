Summary of the workflow diagram of **Magnetic-One Multi-Agent System** presented in its article:

### 1. Outer Loop – Initial Setup and Planning

   - **Task Trigger**: The process begins when a prompt or task is initiated. This prompts the **Orchestrator**, the main coordinating agent, to set up a **Task Ledger**.
   - **Task Ledger Creation**: The Task Ledger acts as a short-term memory for the task, recording key details that will guide the workflow.
   - **Fact and Guess Collection**: The Orchestrator gathers and pre-populates the Task Ledger with known facts, information to look up, derivable data, and educated guesses to frame initial responses.
   - **Plan Formation**: Using the Task Ledger and the capabilities of the available agents, the Orchestrator creates a **step-by-step plan**. This plan provides hints for task execution, guiding each agent in its respective role.
   - **Inner Loop Initiation**: After establishing the plan, the Orchestrator starts the **Inner Loop**.

### 2. Inner Loop – Iterative Task Execution and Monitoring

   During each iteration of the inner loop, the Orchestrator:
   
   - **Evaluates Task Completion**: Checks if the task has been fully satisfied.
   - **Checks for Loops or Stalls**: Monitors for repeated steps or a lack of forward progress.
   - **Makes Adjustments**: If progress is slow or looping is detected, the **Counter** (a stalling indicator) is incremented.
   - **Agent Selection and Instructions**: As long as progress continues or the Counter is within threshold limits, the Orchestrator selects the next agent to act and gives it specific instructions for the task at hand.
   - **Reflection and Self-Refinement**: If the Counter exceeds the threshold, the Orchestrator pauses the inner loop, revisits its previous steps, updates the Task Ledger, and revises the plan. This self-reflection allows the system to adapt and correct any identified issues before resuming the inner loop.

   The inner loop continues until the Orchestrator determines the task is complete or hits a predefined stopping criterion (e.g., maximum attempts or time limits).

### 3. Agents – Specialized Task Execution

   - **WebSurfer**: Manages interactions with a web browser, handling tasks like navigating websites, clicking, typing, or summarizing webpage content.
   - **FileSurfer**: Focuses on navigating and reading files, such as PDFs and images, to retrieve necessary data.
   - **Coder**: Develops, analyzes, or debugs code as needed for the task.
   - **ComputerTerminal**: Executes code or installs libraries to support programming tasks, interacting with a console environment.

   Each agent specializes in particular actions, and the Orchestrator directs agents as needed to accomplish the overall task.

### 4. Termination and Final Reporting

   - Once the task is complete or the termination conditions are met, both the outer and inner loops end.
   - **Final Review and Report**: The Orchestrator reviews all progress records and the Task Ledger to produce either a final solution or its best educated guess if uncertainties remain.

In summary, the workflow allows the Orchestrator to iteratively guide agents, adapt to challenges, and refine its approach in real time. This multi-layered control ensures robust task execution even in complex, dynamic environments.

"""
The following expanded code structure integrates each part of the **Magnetic-One Multi-Agent System** workflow, ensuring that the Orchestrator manages agents within an inner/outer loop, assigns agents to prevent stalls, and generates a comprehensive final report based on the Task Ledger.

This code an intent to perform **Magnetic-One** workflow based on **LangGraph**, it's the version 0.0.1 and still need refinement and testing. **Agents may need tool calling**, it's suggested to create such tools by following: [Creating tools with Hierarchical Agent Teams](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/docs/docs/tutorials/multi_agent/hierarchical_agent_teams.ipynb) and then adjust the code by alligning those tools.
