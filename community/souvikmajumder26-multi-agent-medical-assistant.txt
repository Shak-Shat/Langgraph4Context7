## 🧠 Usage  <a name="usage"></a>

> [!NOTE]
> 1. The first run can be jittery and may get errors - be patient and check the console for ongoing downloads and installations.
> 2. On the first run, many models will be downloaded - yolo for tesseract ocr, computer vision agent models, cross-encoder reranker model, etc.
> 3. Once they are completed, retry. Everything should work seamlessly since all of it is thoroughly tested.

- Upload medical images for **AI-based diagnosis**. Task specific Computer Vision model powered agents - upload images from 'sample_images' folder to try out.
- Ask medical queries to leverage **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** if information in memory or **web-search** to retrieve latest information.  
- Use **voice-based** interaction (speech-to-text and text-to-speech).  
- Review AI-generated insights with **human-in-the-loop verification**.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## 📌 Human-in-the-loop validation of Medical Computer Vision Diagnosis Agents' Outputs <a name="human-in-the-loop"></a>

In `agent_decision.py`:

1. Interrupt the workflow when human validation is needed
2. Store the interrupted state in memory
3. Add endpoints to expose pending validations and submit validation decisions
4. Resume the workflow after the human has provided feedback

On frontend:

1. Check if a response needs validation (needs_validation flag)
2. If so, show a validation interface to the human reviewer
3. Send the validation decision back through the /validate endpoint
4. Continue the conversation

Implemented a complete human-in-the-loop validation system using LangGraph's NodeInterrupt functionality, integrated with the backend and frontend.

    the appropriate specialized agent. Your job is to analyze the user's request and determine which agent 
    is best suited to handle it based on the query content, presence of images, and conversation context.

    Available agents:
    1. CONVERSATION_AGENT - For general chat, greetings, and non-medical questions.
    2. RAG_AGENT - For specific medical knowledge questions that can be answered from established medical literature. Currently ingested medical knowledge involves 'introduction to brain tumor', 'deep learning techniques to diagnose and detect brain tumors', 'deep learning techniques to diagnose and detect covid / covid-19 from chest x-ray'.
    3. WEB_SEARCH_PROCESSOR_AGENT - For questions about recent medical developments, current outbreaks, or time-sensitive medical information.
    4. BRAIN_TUMOR_AGENT - For analysis of brain MRI images to detect and segment tumors.
    5. CHEST_XRAY_AGENT - For analysis of chest X-ray images to detect abnormalities.
    6. SKIN_LESION_AGENT - For analysis of skin lesion images to classify them as benign or malignant.

    Make your decision based on these guidelines:
    - If the user has not uploaded any image, always route to the conversation agent.
    - If the user uploads a medical image, decide which medical vision agent is appropriate based on the image type and the user's query. If the image is uploaded without a query, always route to the correct medical vision agent based on the image type.
    - If the user asks about recent medical developments or current health situations, use the web search pocessor agent.
    - If the user asks specific medical knowledge questions, use the RAG agent.
    - For general conversation, greetings, or non-medical questions, use the conversation agent. But if image is uploaded, always go to the medical vision agents first.

    You must provide your answer in JSON format with the following structure:
    {{
    "agent": "AGENT_NAME",
    "reasoning": "Your step-by-step reasoning for selecting this agent",
    "confidence": 0.95  // Value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating your confidence in this decision

        You are an AI-powered Medical Conversation Assistant. Your goal is to facilitate smooth and informative conversations with users, handling both casual and medical-related queries. You must respond naturally while ensuring medical accuracy and clarity.

        ### Role & Capabilities
        - Engage in **general conversation** while maintaining professionalism.
        - Answer **medical questions** using verified knowledge.
        - Route **complex queries** to RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) or web search if needed.
        - Handle **follow-up questions** while keeping track of conversation context.
        - Redirect **medical images** to the appropriate AI analysis agent.

        ### Guidelines for Responding:
        1. **General Conversations:**
        - If the user engages in casual talk (e.g., greetings, small talk), respond in a friendly, engaging manner.
        - Keep responses **concise and engaging**, unless a detailed answer is needed.

        2. **Medical Questions:**
        - If you have **high confidence** in answering, provide a medically accurate response.
        - Ensure responses are **clear, concise, and factual**.

        3. **Follow-Up & Clarifications:**
        - Maintain conversation history for better responses.
        - If a query is unclear, ask **follow-up questions** before answering.

        4. **Handling Medical Image Analysis:**
        - Do **not** attempt to analyze images yourself.
        - If user speaks about analyzing or processing or detecting or segmenting or classifying any disease from any image, ask the user to upload the image so that in the next turn it is routed to the appropriate medical vision agents.
        - If an image was uploaded, it would have been routed to the medical computer vision agents. Read the history to know about the diagnosis results and continue conversation if user asks anything regarding the diagnosis.
        - After processing, **help the user interpret the results**.

        5. **Uncertainty & Ethical Considerations:**
        - If unsure, **never assume** medical facts.
        - Recommend consulting a **licensed healthcare professional** for serious medical concerns.
        - Avoid providing **medical diagnoses** or **prescriptions**—stick to general knowledge.

        ### Response Format:
        - Maintain a **conversational yet professional tone**.
        - Use **bullet points or numbered lists** for clarity when needed.
        - If pulling from external sources (RAG/Web Search), mention **where the information is from** (e.g., "According to Mayo Clinic...").
        - If a user asks for a diagnosis, remind them to **seek medical consultation**.

        ### Example User Queries & Responses:

        **User:** "Hey, how's your day going?"
        **You:** "I'm here and ready to help! How can I assist you today?"

        **User:** "I have a headache and fever. What should I do?"
        **You:** "I'm not a doctor, but headaches and fever can have various causes, from infections to dehydration. If your symptoms persist, you should see a medical professional."

## 3.2.6. Star-Shape Loss

In contrast to pixel-wise losses which act on pixels independently and cannot enforce spatial constraints, the star-shape loss (Mirikharaji and Hamarneh, 2018) aims to capture class label dependencies and preserve the target object structure in the predicted segmentation masks. Based upon prior knowledge about the shape of skin lesions, the star-shape loss, L ssh penalizes discontinuous decisions in the estimated output as follows:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { s s h } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \sum _ { p \in \Omega } \sum _ { q \in \mathcal { I } _ { p c } } \mathbb { 1 } _ { y _ { i p } = y _ { i q } } \times | y _ { i p } - \hat { y } _ { i p } | \times | \hat { y } _ { i p } - \hat { y } _ { i q } |, \\ \intertext { n center. } \mathcal { I } _ { s s h } \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$ } \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime`} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime$} \, \text{$\prime`}}$$

where c is the lesion center, ' pc is the line segment connecting pixels p and c and, q is any pixel lying on ' pc . This loss encourages all pixels lying between p and q on ' pc to be assigned the same estimator whenever p and q have the same ground-truth label. The result is a radial spatial coherence from the lesion center.


## 3.2.7. End-Point Error Loss

Many authors consider the lesion boundary the most challenging region to segment. The end-point error loss (Sarker et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019) underscores borders by using the first derivative of the segmentation masks instead of their raw values:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { e p e } ( X, Y ; \theta ) & = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \sum _ { p \in \Omega } \sqrt { ( \xi _ { i p } ^ { 0 } - y _ { i p } ^ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 } + ( \xi _ { i p } ^ { 1 } - y _ { i p } ^ { 1 } ) ^ { 2 } } ),$$

where ˆ 0 y ip and ˆ y 1 ip are the directional first derivatives of the estimated segmentation map in the x and y spatial directions, respectively and, similarly, y 0 ip and y 1 ip for the ground-truth derivatives. Thus, this loss function encourages the magnitude and orientation of edges of estimation and ground-truth to match, thereby mitigating vague boundaries in skin lesion segmentation.


## 3.2.8. Adversarial Loss

Another way to add high-order class-label consistency is adversarial training. Adversarial training may be employed along with traditional supervised training to distinguish estimated segmentation from ground-truths using a discriminator. The optimization objective will weight a pixel-wise loss L s matching prediction to ground-truth, and an adversarial loss, as follows:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { a d v } ( X, Y ; \theta, \theta _ { a } ) = \mathcal { L } _ { s } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = \lambda [ \mathcal { L } _ { c e } ( Y, 1 ; \theta _ { a } ) + \mathcal { L } _ { c e } ( \hat { Y }, 0 ; \theta, \theta _ { a } ) ],$$

where GLYPH&lt;18&gt; a are the adversarial model parameters. The adversarial loss employs a binary cross-entropy loss to encourage the segmentation model to produce indistinguishable prediction maps from ground-truth maps. The adversarial objective (Eqn. (16)) is optimized in a mini-max game by simultaneously minimizing it with respect to GLYPH&lt;18&gt; and maximizing it with respect to GLYPH&lt;18&gt; a .

Pixel-wise losses, such as cross-entropy (Izadi et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019), soft Jaccard (Sarker et al., 2019; Tu et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019), end-point error (Tu et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2019), MSE (Peng et al., 2019) and MAE (Sarker et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019) losses have all been incorporated in adversarial learning of skin lesion segmentation. In addition, Xue et al. (2018) and Tu et al. (2019) presented a multi-scale adversarial term to match a hierarchy of

<!-- page_break -->

local and global contextual features in the predicted maps and ground-truths. In particular, they minimize the MAE of multi-scale features extracted from di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent layers of the adversarial model.


## 3.2.9. Rank Loss

Assuming that hard-to-predict pixels lead to larger prediction errors while training the model, rank loss (Xie et al., 2020b) is proposed to encourage learning more discriminative information for harder pixels. The image pixels are ranked based on their prediction errors, and the top K pixels with the largest prediction errors from the lesion or background areas are selected. Let ˆ y 0 i j and ˆ y 1 il are respectively the selected j th hard-to-predict pixel of background and l th hard-to-predict pixel of lesion in the image i , we have:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { r a n k } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { K } \sum _ { l = 1 } ^ { K } \max \{ 0, \hat { y } _ { i j } ^ { 0 } - \hat { y } _ { i l } ^ { 1 } + m a r g i n \},$$

which encourages ˆ 1 y il to be greater than ˆ y 0 i j plus margin.

Similar to rank loss, narrowband suppression loss (Deng et al., 2020) also adds a constraint between hard-to-predict pixels of background and lesion. Di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent from rank loss, narrowband suppression loss collects pixels in a narrowband along the groundtruth lesion boundary with radius r instead of all image pixels and then selects the top K pixels with the largest prediction errors.


## 4. Evaluation

Evaluation is one of the main challenges for any image segmentation task, skin lesions included (Celebi et al., 2015b). Segmentation evaluation may be subjective or objective (Zhang et al., 2008), the former involving the visual assessment of the results by a panel of human experts, and the latter involving the comparison of the results with ground-truth segmentations using quantitative evaluation metrics.

Subjective evaluation may provide a nuanced assessment of results, but because experts must grade each batch of results, it is usually too laborious to be applied, except in limited settings. In objective assessment, experts are consulted once, to provide the ground-truth segmentations, and that knowledge can then be reused indefinitely. However, due to intra- and inter-annotator variations, it raises the question of whether any individual ground-truth segmentation reflects the ideal 'true' segmentation, an issue we address in Section 4.2. It also raises the issue of choosing one or more evaluation metrics (Section 4.3).

## Deep learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks by learning patterns and representations directly from data. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that require manual feature engineering, deep learning algorithms autonomously extract hierarchical features from data, leading to the creation of powerful and highly accurate   models 18-20 . In this study, a CNN architecture is employed.


## Convolution neural network

Convolutional neural networks represent a major breakthrough in deep learning and computer vision. These architectures are specifically designed to extract meaningful features from complex visual data, such as images and video. The inherent structure of the CNN, consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, mimics the ability of the human visual system to recognize patterns and hierarchical features. Convolutional layers use convolutional operations to detect local features, which are then progressively abstracted by pooling layers that condense the information. The resulting hierarchical representations are then fed into fully connected layers for classification or regression tasks. CNN have redefined the landscape of image recognition, achieving remarkable success in diverse domains ranging from image classification and object detection to face recognition and medical image   analysis 21 .

## The proposed framework

In this section, the proposed framework has been explained. First, the used chest X-ray dataset has been described. Then, the developed framework, which includes 'pre-processing' phase and the 'Classification using CNN models based on transfer learning' phase, has been illustrated. Two different approaches have been used to train pre-trained CNN models using transfer learning. The first approach uses whole chest X-ray images, while the other approach uses lung-segmented images.


## Used datasets

In this research, the data obtained from the 'COVID-19 Radiography Database' has been used to apply the proposed framework. The database contains thousands of publicly available benchmark X-ray images and corresponding lung masks. The X-ray images are provided in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format with a resolution of 299 × 299 pixels. The database includes 10,192 Normal cases, 3616 positive COVID-19 cases, 1345 Viral Pneumonia cases, and 6012 Lung Opacity images as shown in Table1. This database was developed by a team from Qatar University, Dhaka University, Bangladesh with cooperators from Malaysia and Pakistan and cooperators of medical   doctors 26 . Figure 1 illustrates samples from different classes in the COVID-19 Radiography Database.


## Preprocessing

The purpose of the pre-processing phase is to prepare the X-ray images for classification using CNN pre-trained models. In this phase, different pre-processing steps are applied to improve the performance of the classification. The pre-processing steps can be summarized as follows:

| Classes         | Normal   |   Positive COVID-19 |   Viral pneumonia |   Lung opacity |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Number of cases | 10,192   |                3616 |              1345 |           6012 |

## Image enhancement

Enhancing images is a significant step for the correct classification. It increases image contrast in order to improve classification performance. Different techniques can be applied to enhance the images. In this research, some of these techniques have been applied to the original X-ray images before introducing them to the classification models, they are as follows:

- 1. Histogram Equalization (HE): The purpose of histogram equalization (HE) is to spread the gray levels inside the image. It modifies the brightness and contrast of the images to improve the image   quality 27 . The original X-ray images' intensity has been enhanced using histogram equalization (HE).
- 2. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE): It originated from Global Histogram Equalization (GHE), it is based on dividing the image into non-overlapping blocks, and after that, the histogram of each block is gotten using a pre-specified   value 28 . In this research, CLAHE has been used to enhance the contrast of original X-ray images.
- 3. Image Complement: The complement or inverse of X-ray images transforms the dark positions to lighter and the light positions to darker. As this is a standard process, which is similar to that used by radiologists, it may aid a deep learning model for improving classification performance. The complement of the binary image can be obtained by changing the zeros to ones and ones to zeros. Whereas for a grayscale image, each pixel is subtracted from 255.

Figure 2 shows an original X-ray image and its enhanced versions after applying HE, CLAHE and image complement on the original image with the corresponding histogram plots for each version.


## Segmentation

In the segmentation step, the regions of interest (ROI), which are the lungs region in our case, are cropped from the associated image. In this research, the ground truth lungs' masks which are provided by the database have been used. A modified U-Net model was applied by the authors of the database on the X-ray images to get the lung masks associated with the full X-ray images. In this research, multiplication between each original image and the associated lung mask has been applied to get the segmented lungs. The same process of multiplication between different enhanced image versions and the associated masks has been applied to get different versions of segmented datasets with different enhancements. All these versions are introduced to CNN models as segmented versions of data. Figure 3 shows the segmented images of the original image and of the different enhanced images for one of the COVID samples.


## Resizing images phase

Resizing the images is an essential process to satisfy the requirement of CNN of equally sized input images. In this research, the process of resizing X-ray images has been done to fit all X-ray images to the input size of the used pre-trained CNN models which are VGG19 and EfficientNetB0. Therefore, all images' versions either full or segmented versions were resized to fit the CNNs input image size which is 224 × 224 pixels. To expedite

## Approval for participation

As the data is open source, there are no experiments on humans conducted by the authors. Open source has been studied on MRI images.


## Experimental settings and results

This study addresses the problem of image classification using deep learning methods. The most important and widely studied of these problems is that of health images. In this context, five different models (InceptionV3, EfficientNetB4, VGG16, VGG19, Multi-Layer CNN) were selected for the classification of brain tumors and their performances were compared on the same dataset. 10% of the dataset was used for testing, 15% for validation and 75% for training. All experimental setup and results were done at Google Colab.


## Multi-layer CNN

First, we need to determine the architecture of our model. The input form of our data is 400 × 400 and has 3 channels. Since we have a total of 4 different classes, the number of output classes is set to 4. Our model has a structure that includes convolutional and pooling layers. First, there is a 3 × 3 convolutional layer with 32 filters. This is followed by a 2 × 2 max pooling layer. This reduces the size by emphasizing lower-level features. To deepen our model, this structure is repeated twice, adding convolutional layers with 64 and 128 filters, respectively, and maximum pooling layers of size 2 × 2.

Table 2. Confusion matrix.

picture_counter_2 The image is a confusion matrix used in the context of evaluating the performance of a classification model. It displays the actual values (Positive, Negative, Total) and the estimated values (Positive, Negative, Total). The matrix includes True Positives (Tp), False Positives (Fp), True Negatives (Tn), and False Negatives (Fn), along with their respective totals (TPos, TNeg, Pos, Neg, M).

|                | Actual value   | Actual value   | Actual value   |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
|                | Positive       | Negative       | Total          |
| Estimate value | Estimate value | Estimate value | Estimate value |
| Positive       | T p            | F p            | TPos           |
| Negative       | F N            | T N            | TNeg           |
| Total          | Pos            | Neg            | M              |

The resulting feature map is transformed into a flat vector with a flattening layer. A hidden (dense) layer of 128 neurons is then added. This layer deepens the learned features and increases generalization. Finally, the output layer has 4 neurons and calculates the probabilities between classes with the softmax activation function. To train our model, we need to determine the optimal function and metrics. In this paper, we use the Rectified Adam optimization algorithm. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the learning rate and helps to use gradients more efficiently. Also, categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function during training, as it is widely used in multiclass classification task.

The metrics tracked during training are accuracy, as well as precision and recall. These metrics are important for evaluating the classification performance of the model. In addition, a reduced learning rate recall (ReduceLROnPlateau) is used to dynamically adjust the learning rate. This recall reduces the learning rate when the loss function flattens out during the training process, resulting in more stable training. The epoch is set to 14 and the batch size to 10.


## CNN-based transfer learning

In transfer learning architectures, all parameters and layers outside the model are the same, but after the last 3 layers of transfer learning models are removed, layers unique to the dataset are added instead: the GlobalAveragePooling2D layer contains fewer parameters than the Flatten layer, which reduces the risk of overfitting and helps build a more efficient model. Also, while the Flatten layer is used to organize the data, the GlobalAveragePooling2D layer is used for feature extraction, making the network learning process more efficient.

Due to the fact that the training data tends to learn very fast compared to the validation data, we modified the ratio of the dropout layers in the original architectures. For all models, the dilution rate was set to 0.05. During the model training process, the designated optimizer was "RectifiedAdam", with the optimizer parameters configured as follows: learning\_rate = 0.0001, beta\_1 = 0.9, beta\_2 = 0.999, and epsilon = 1e-08. The loss function selected is categorical\_crossentropy, while the metrics used include precision, recall, categorical accuracy, and accuracy. This completes the pre-training of the model. The final layer of the model is the dense layer, which contains 4 neurons, which is usually the number of output classes in classification problems. The activation function of this layer is "softmax". The softmax function makes the output values interpretable as probabilities between classes. Furthermore, the data type of this layer is "float64", which means that the output values are of a 64-bit double precision type. The layer also applies regularization using the "kernel\_regularizer" property. The L2 regularization used here aims to reduce the risk of overfitting by limiting the size of the weights. The regularization coefficient of 0.1, denoted by "regulars. l2 (0.1)", controls the effectiveness of the regularization.

During the model training process, the "ReduceLROnPlateau" function of the Keras library was used as a backpropagation algorithm. This function automatically reduced the learning rate when the model approached a local optimum or when the loss value did not decrease. The parameters of the "ReduceLROnPlateau" function are as follows monitor: The metric monitored is usually "val\_loss" (validation loss). This is the metric used to determine if the learning rate should be reduced:

- · patience: The expected patience time for lowering the learning rate, i.e. how long the metric should not improve.
- · factor: The factor used to reduce the learning rate. For example, a value of 0.3 reduces the learning rate by 30%.
- · min\_lr: Specifies the minimum achievable learning rate. This limits the learning rate without making it infinitesimal.

Using this feature allows for more stable and efficient model training, streamlining the process of fine-tuning training parameters without the need to manually adjust the learning rate. The training program was run over 14 epochs with batches of size 10. Details of the multilayer CNN model used in the study are presented in Fig. 2, which outlines its architectural features.

The training and validation accuracy loss graphs of the models created with VGG19, EfficientNetB4, InceptionV3 transfer learning, and CNN are shown in Fig. 3.

Table 3 shows the accuracy, F-score, Recall, Precision and AUC results of the models created in the study.

picture_counter_3 The image depicts a neural network architecture for medical imaging analysis. It starts with an MRI brain scan, followed by layers of convolution and max pooling operations. These layers are then flattened and fed into a fully connected neural network. The output layer classifies the input into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary.

According to Table 3, the best accuracy result was obtained by VGG16 with 97%. It is ahead of other methods with F-score value of 97%, AUC value of 99%, recall value of 98% and precision values of 98%. The ROC curves of the models created in the study are shown in Fig. 4.

According to the AUC values in Fig. 4, the transfer learning models VGG, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB4 and the models built with CNN have distinctive features. The confusion matrix of the study on the classification of glioma, meningioma, non-tumor normal patients, pituitary tumor patients in the dataset by tumor type is shown in Fig. 5.

As shown in the confusion matrix in Fig. 5, the classification performance is high for all four models (VGG16 and VGG19 models, CNN model, EfficientNetB4 model, InceptionV3 model).


## Results and discussion

As part of the study, CNN and CNN-based transfer learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetB4, VGG19 were trained on open-source shared brain tumor patients. The best accuracy result was obtained with EfficientNetB4 with 95%. The comparison of the brain tumor studies with the literature is shown in Table 4.

As shown in Table 4, the CNN-based transfer learning models used in the study performed better. AI in healthcare plays an important role in the management of complex diseases such as brain tumors. AI enables faster, more accurate, and more effective diagnosis and treatment processes. However, AI technology is not intended to completely replace doctors, but to support and enhance their work. To realize the full potential of AI, it is important to consider issues such as ethics, security and privacy. In the future, AI-based solutions will continue to contribute to better management of brain tumors and other health problems, and improve the quality of life

for patients. As seen in this study, AI-based studies will increase their importance to human health, from early diagnosis to positive progress in the treatment process.

Based on the results of this study, transfer learning methods should be preferred especially in image processing-based applications to support health decision makers. The data obtained from MRI or CT can be used as an early warning system to help health decision makers make quick and accurate decisions. Therefore, in addition to empirical analysis, AI-based applications should take a more active role as soon as possible. To this end, the diagnosis of diseases from instant CT or MR images will be investigated in the coming years.

Craniopharyngioma

Epidermoid

Lymphoma

Meningioma

Schwannoma (neuroma)

Pituitary adenoma

Pinealoma (pineocytoma, pineoblastoma)

Medulloblastoma

he World Health Organization (WHO) developed a lassification and grading system to standardize ommunication, treatment planning, and predict utcomes for brain tumors. Tumors are classified by heir cell type and grade by viewing the cells, sually taken during a biopsy, under a microscope. T c c o t u

- · Cell type. Refers to the cell of origin of the tumor. For example, nerve cells (neurons) and support cells (glial and schwann cells) give rise to tumors. About half of all primary brain tumors grow from glial cells (gliomas). There are many types of gliomas because there are different kinds of glial cells.
- · Grade . Refers to the way tumor cells look under the microscope and is an indication of aggressiveness (e.g., low grade means least aggressive and high grade means most aggressive) (Table 1). Tumors often have a mix of cell grades and can change as they grow. Differentiated and anaplastic are terms used to describe how similar or abnormal the tumor cells appear compared to normal cells.


## Table 1. Glioma Grading Scale.

| Grade   | Characteristics                                                                                                                               |

| II      | Relatively slow growing cells Slightly abnormal appearance Can invade nearby tissue Sometimes recur as a higher grade                         |
| III     | Actively reproducing abnormal cells Abnormal appearance Infiltrate normal tissue Tend to recur, often as a higher grade                       |
| IV      | Rapidly reproducing abnormal cells Very abnormal appearance Area of dead cells (necrosis) in center Form new blood vessels to maintain growth |

## Transfer learning

Transfer learning stands as a fundamental concept within both machine learning and deep learning, involving the utilization of knowledge garnered from training a model on a particular task and subsequently applying that knowledge to another related task. In the realm of neural networks, transfer learning manifests significant potency. It encompasses the process of employing a pre-trained model, typically trained on a comprehensive and varied dataset, and fine-tuning it on a fresh dataset or task 21-23 .

In this study, transfer learning models InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, and EfficientNetB4 were used in the classification process.


## VGG

This architecture stands as a notable CNN model introduced   by 24 , which builds upon its predecessor, the AlexNet model. It achieves this enhancement by replacing the initial 11 × 11 and 5 × 5 kernels in the first two convolutional layers with a series of consecutive 3 × 3 kernels. The model occupies approximately 528 MB of storage space and has achieved a documented top-5 accuracy of 90.1% on ImageNet data, encompassing approximately 138.4 million parameters. The ImageNet dataset comprises approximately 14 million images categorized across 1000 classes. The training of VGG16 was conducted on robust GPUs over the span of several weeks. This study used VGG16 and VGG19.


## EfficientNET

EfficientNet is a family of scalable and efficient CNN models. The main goal of this series is to achieve better performance with fewer parameters. The term "EfficientNet" is a combination of the words "efficiency" and "network". The model series is mainly used in visual processing tasks such as image classification.

EfficientNet is a family of models that delivers competitive results in both performance and computational cost. It offers variations of different size and complexity at different scales. Higher numbered models are typically larger and more complex, but require more computing power. It was the top performing model in the ImageNet ompetition c 24 .


## Inception

The Inception architecture is an architecture used in the field of deep learning and CNN. It is designed to perform feature extraction and classification tasks more efficiently. First introduced in a paper titled "Going Deeper with Convolutions", the Inception architecture aims to provide better performance when processing complex visual datasets 25 . The Inception architecture has a structure that includes parallel convolution layers and combines the outputs of these layers. In this way, features of different sizes can be captured and processed   simultaneously 25 .

## Performance metric

Performance evaluation methods such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-score are used to evaluate models created for classification problems such as image processing. These methods are obtained from the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is given in Table 2 26 .

In Table 2, the symbols TN , TP , FP ,  and FN correspond to the true negative, true positive, false positive, and false negative values, respectively. From Eqs. (1) to (4), Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-score is given respectively.

$$\ A c c u r a c y = \frac { T _ { P } + T _ { N } } { T _ { P } + F _ { P } + F _ { N } + T _ { N } }$$

$$P r e c i s i o n = \frac { T _ { P } } { T P o s }$$

$$R e c a l l & = \frac { T _ { P } } { P o s }$$

$$F \text{-score} = \frac { 2 * P r e c i s i o n * R e c a l l } { P r e c i s i o n + R e c e l l }$$

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

The ROC Curve is a graphical tool used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly in binary classification scenarios. It provides a visualization of the sensitivity and specificity of the model, showing their variation as thresholds are changed 27 . The ROC curve is plotted with the false positive rate on the x-axis and the True Positive Rate (TPR) on the y-axis. An optimal classifier, characterized by a TPR of one and a false positive rate of zero, lies in the upper left corner of the graph. The curve takes shape around this point, illustrating the performance of the model across different   thresholds 26 .

In addition, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, commonly referred to as the "area under the curve", succinctly summarizes the overall model performance in a single metric. The AUC value ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating the increased discriminative ability of the   model 26 . The ROC curve and AUC value serve as essential tools for comparing models and understanding classification model performance. A higher AUC value generally indicates superior model performance, while the curve illustrates the model's performance strengths and weaknesses at various   thresholds 26 .

## Radiation

at brain tumors. Radiation works by damaging Radiation therapy uses controlled high-energy rays to tre the DNA inside cells making them unable to divide and reproduce. The goal of radiation therapy is to maximize the dose to abnormal cells and minimize exposure to normal cells (Fig. 5). The benefits of radiation are not immediate but occur over time. Aggressive tumors, whose cells divide rapidly, typically respond more quickly to radiation. There are two ways to deliver radiation, external and internal beams.

<!-- page_break -->

xternal beam radiation is delivered from outside he body by a machine that aims high-energy rays x-rays, gamma rays) at the tumor. E t (

- · Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers a high dose of radiation during a single session. Although it is called surgery, no incision is made.
- · Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSR) delivers lower doses of radiation over many visits. Patients return daily over several weeks to receive the complete radiation dose.
- · Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) delivers the radiation dose to the entire brain. It is often used to treat multiple brain tumors and metastases.

Internal radiation (brachytherapy) is delivered from nside the body by surgically placing radioactive material (sealed in catheters, seeds, or balloons) irectly into the tumor. After the patient undergoes a craniotomy to remove the tumor, the radioactive material is placed inside the tumor cavity. The radiation dose is delivered to the first few millimeters of tissue that surrounded the tumor avity where malignant cells may still remain. Patients have no risk of radiation injury to other parts of their own body or to others around them because the radiation dose is precisely delivered and short lived. i d c


## Chemotherapy

hemotherapy drugs work by interrupting cell division. However, it affects not only tumor cells but ormal cells, thus causing side effects, especially in ast growing cells (e.g., hair, digestive, blood). reatment is delivered in cycles with rest periods in etween to allow the body to rebuild healthy cells. hemotherapy drugs can be administered orally as pill, intravenously (IV), or as a wafer placed urgically into the tumor. The drugs most ommonly used to treat brain tumors are armustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and emozolomide (Temodar). Chemotherapy is also sed as a radio-sensitizing agent that increases umor cell death during radiation therapy. Agents hat often work in high-grade gliomas include rocarbazine, platinum analogs (cisplatin, arboplatin), the nitrosureas (BCNU, CCNU), and lkylating agents (temozolomide, vincristine). BCNU as been proven effective when applied locally to he tumor bed after the tumor has been removed. y applying it directly to the diseased area of the rain, side effects are limited and the drug has a outinely used for benign tumors.

## Adjunct therapies

- · Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines.
- · Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies.
- · Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor's responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis.

Figure 5. The radiation beam is shaped to match the tumor and minimize exposure to normal brain tissue. The colored rings represent the radiation dose level.

picture_counter_6 The image is an axial MRI scan of the brain, showing a specific slice (slice no. 18). There are colored contours overlaid on the scan, indicating different levels of radiation dosage (9.00 Gy, 16.00 Gy, 32.00 Gy, and 100.0% x 20.00 Gy). The contours are color-coded: green for 9.00 Gy, orange for 16.00 Gy, red for 32.00 Gy, and a combination for 100.0% x 20.00 Gy. The image also includes a small graphical representation in the bottom left corner, likely indicating the orientation or reference for the scan.


## Clinical trials

Clinical trials are research studies in which new treatments-drugs, diagnostics, procedures, and other therapies-are tested in people to see if they are safe and effective. Research is always being conducted to improve the standard of medical care. Information about current clinical trials, including eligibility, protocol, and locations, are found on the Web. Studies can be sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (see clinicaltrials.gov) as well as private industry and pharmaceutical companies (see www.centerwatch.com).

## 3. Model Design and Training

Multi-layer perceptrons ( MLP s) for pixel-level classification (Gish and Blanz, 1989; Katz and Merickel, 1989) appeared soon after the publication of the seminal backpropagation paper (Rumelhart et al., 1986), but these shallow feed-forward networks had many drawbacks (LeCun et al., 1998), including an excessive number of parameters, lack of invariance, and disregard for the inherent structure present in images.

CNN s are deep feedforward neural networks designed to extract progressively more abstract features from multidimensional signals (1-D signals, 2-D images, 3-D video, etc.) (LeCun et al., 2015). Therefore, in addition to addressing the aforementioned problems of MLP s, CNN s automate feature engineering (Bengio et al., 2013), that is, the design of algorithms that can transform raw signal values to discriminative features. Another advantage of CNNs over traditional machine learning classifiers is that they require minimal preprocessing of the input data. Due to their significant advantages, CNN s have become the method of choice in many medical image analysis applications over the past decade (Litjens et al., 2017). The key enablers in this deep learning revolution were: (i) the availability of massive data sets; (ii) the availability of powerful and inexpensive graphics processing units; (iii) the development of better network architectures, learning algorithms, and regularization techniques; and (iv) the development of open-source deep learning frameworks.

Semantic segmentation may be understood as the attempt to answer the parallel and complementary questions 'what' and 'where' in a given image. The former is better answered by translation-invariant global features, while the latter requires welllocalized features, posing a challenge to deep models. CNN s for pixel-level classification first appeared in the mid-2000s (Ning et al., 2005), but their use accelerated after the seminal paper on FCN s by Long et al. (2015), which, along with U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), have become the basis for many state-of-the-art segmentation models. In contrast to classification CNN s (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, VGG , GoogLeNet, ResNet), FCN s easily cope with arbitrary-sized input images.


## 3.1. Architecture

An ideal skin lesion segmentation algorithm is accurate, computationally inexpensive, invariant to noise and input transformations, requires little training data and is easy to implement and train. Unfortunately, no algorithm has, so far, been able to achieve these conflicting goals. DL -based segmentation tends towards accuracy and invariance at the cost of computation and training data. Ease of implementation is debatable: on the one hand, the algorithms often forgo cumbersome preprocessing, postprocessing, and feature engineering steps. On the other hand, tuning and optimizing them is often a painstaking task.

As shown in Fig. 6, we have classified the existing literature into single-network models, multiple-network models, hybridfeature models, and Transformer models. The first and second groups are somewhat self-descriptive, but notice that the latter is further divided into ensembles of models, multi-task methods (often performing simultaneous classification and segmentation), and GAN s. Hybrid-feature models combine DL with hand-crafted features. Transformer models, as the name suggests, employ

Fig. 6: Taxonomy of DL -based skin lesion segmentation model architectures.

picture_counter_20 The image is a diagram illustrating various segmentation model architectures used in artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosing diseases. It is divided into three main categories: Single Network Models, Multiple Network Models, and Hybrid Feature Models. Each category has subcategories:

1. Single Network Models:
   - Shortcut Connections (§3.1.1.1)
   - Conv. Modules (§3.1.1.2)
   - Multi-scale Modules (§3.1.1.3)
   - Attention Modules (§3.1.1.4)
   - Recurrent CNNs (§3.1.1.5)

2. Multiple Network Models:
   - Ensembles (§3.1.2.1)
   - Multi-task Models (§3.1.2.2)
   - GANs (§3.1.2.3)

3. Hybrid Feature Models:
   - Transformer Models (§3.1.4)

The central node is labeled "Segmentation Model Architectures §3.1" and branches out to the different categories and subcategories.

Transformers either with or without CNNs for segmentation, and have started being used for skin lesion segmentation only recently. We classified works according to their most relevant feature, but the architectural improvements discussed in Section 3.1.1 also appear in the models listed in the other sections. In Fig. 7, we show how frequently di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent architectural modules appear in the 177 surveyed works, grouped by our taxonomy of model architectures (Fig. 6).

Table 3 summarizes all the 177 surveyed works in this review, with the following attributes for each work: type of publication, datasets, architectural modules, loss functions, and augmentations used, reported Jaccard index, whether the paper performed cross-dataset evaluation ( CDE ) and postprocessing ( PP ), and whether the corresponding code was released publicly. For papers that reported segmentation results on more than 1 dataset, we list all of them and list the performance on only one dataset, formatting that particular dataset in bold. Since ISIC 2017 is the most popular dataset (Fig. 3), wherever reported, we note the performance (Jaccard index) on ISIC 2017. For papers that do not report the Jaccard index and instead report the Dice score, we compute the former based on the latter and report this computed score denoted by an asterisk. Cross-dataset evaluation ( CDE ) refers to when a paper trained model(s) on one dataset but evaluated on another..


## 3.1.1. Single Network Models

The approaches in this section employ a single DL model, usually an FCN , following an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder extracts increasingly abstract features, and the decoder outputs the segmentation mask. In this section, we discuss these architectural choices for designing deep models for skin lesion segmentation.

Earlier DL -based skin lesion segmentation works adopted either FCN (Long et al., 2015) or U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015).

<!-- page_break -->

Fig. 7: The frequency of utilization of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent architectural modules in the surveyed studies. Shortcut connections, particularly, skip connections (112 papers) and residual connections (70 papers) are the two most frequent components in DL -based skin lesion segmentation models. Attention mechanisms learn dependencies between elements in sequences, either spatially or channel-wise, and are therefore used by several encoder-decoder-style segmentation models (41 papers). Dilated convolutions help expand the receptive field of CNN -models without any additional parameters, which is why they are the most popular variant of convolution in the surveyed studies (35 papers). Finally, papers using Transformers (12 papers) started appearing from 2021 onwards and are on the rise.

picture_counter_21 The image is a bar plot from a medical research paper demonstrating the use of artificial intelligence techniques in diagnosing diseases. The bar plot categorizes various AI techniques and their frequency of usage. The categories include Shortcut Connections, Convolutional Modules, Multi-scale Modules, GAN, Attention Modules, RCNN, and Transformer. Each category is further broken down into specific techniques such as dense connection, Transformer, recurrent CNN, attention module, GAN, pyramid pooling, image pyramid, parallel multi-scale convolution, factorized convolution, separable convolution, global convolution, dilated convolution, skip connection, and residual connection, which are color-coded in the legend. The y-axis represents the frequency, with Shortcut Connections being the most frequent, followed by Attention Modules and others.

FCN originally comprised a backbone of VGG 16 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) CNN layers in the encoder and a single deconvolution layer in the encoder. The original paper proposes three versions, two with skip connections ( FCN -8 and FCN -16), and one without them (FCN-32). U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), originally proposed for segmenting electron microscopy images, was rapidly adopted in the medical image segmentation literature. As its name suggests, it is a U-shaped model, with an encoder stacking convolutional layers that double in size filterwise, intercalated by pooling layers, and a symmetric decoder with pooling layers replaced by up-convolutions. Skip connections between corresponding encoder-decoder blocks improve the flow of information between layers, preserving low-level features lost during pooling and producing detailed segmentation boundaries.

U-Net frequently appears in the skin lesion segmentation literature both in its original form (Codella et al., 2017; Pollastri et al., 2020; Ramani and Ranjani, 2019) and modified forms (Tang et al., 2019a; Alom et al., 2019; Hasan et al., 2020), discussed below. Some works introduce their own models (Yuan et al., 2017; Al-Masni et al., 2018).

3.1.1.1. Shortcut Connections. Connections between early and late layers in FCN s have been widely explored to improve both the forward and backward (gradient) information flow in the models, facilitating the training. The three most popular types of connections are described below.

Residual connections : Creating non-linear blocks that add their unmodified inputs to their outputs (He et al., 2016) alleviates gradient degradation in very deep networks. It provides a direct path for the gradient to flow through to the early layers of the network, while still allowing for very deep models. The technique appears often in skin lesion segmentation, in the implementation of the encoder (Sarker et al., 2018; Baghersalimi et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2017a) or both encoder and decoder (He et al., 2017; Venkatesh et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018a; Tu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a; He et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2018). Residual connections have also appeared in recurrent units (Alom et al., 2019, 2020), dense blocks (Song et al., 2019), chained pooling (He et al., 2017;

<!-- page_break -->

Li et al., 2018a; He et al., 2018), and 1-D factorized convolutions (Singh et al., 2019).

Skip connections appear in encoder-decoder architectures, connecting high-resolution features from the encoder's contracting path to the semantic features on the decoder's expanding path (Ronneberger et al., 2015). These connections help preserve localization, especially near region boundaries, and combine multi-scale features, resulting in sharper boundaries in the predicted segmentation. Skip connections are very popular in skin lesion segmentation because they are e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ective and easy to implement (Zhang et al., 2019a; Baghersalimi et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019; Venkatesh et al., 2018; Azad et al., 2019; He et al., 2017; Alom et al., 2019; Sarker et al., 2018; Zeng and Zheng, 2018; Li et al., 2018a; Tu et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2017a; Singh et al., 2019; He et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2018; Alom et al., 2020; Vesal et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2019b).

Dense connections expand the convolutional layers by connecting each layer to all its subsequent layers, concatenating their features (Huang et al., 2017). Iterative reuse of features in dense connections maximizes information flow forward and backward. Similar to deep supervision (Section 3.2.5), the gradient is propagated backwards directly through all previous layers. Several works (Zeng and Zheng, 2018; Song et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021c; Tu et al., 2019; Vesal et al., 2018b) integrated dense blocks in both the encoder and the decoder. Baghersalimi et al. (2019), Hasan et al. (2020) and Wei et al. (2019) used multiple dense blocks iteratively in only the encoder, while Li et al. (2018a) proposed dense deconvolutional blocks to reuse features from the previous layers. Azad et al. (2019) encoded densely connected convolutions into the bottleneck of their encoder-decoder to obtain better features.

3.1.1.2. Convolutional Modules. As mentioned earlier, convolution not only provides a structural advantage, respecting the local connectivity structure of images in the output futures, but also dramatically improves parameter sharing since the parameters of a relatively small convolutional kernel are shared by all patches of a large image. Convolution is a critical element of deep segmentation models. In this section, we discuss some new convolution variants, which have enhanced and diversified this operation, appearing in the skin lesion segmentation literature.

Dilated convolution : In contrast to requiring full-resolution outputs in dense prediction networks, pooling and striding operations have been adopted in deep convolutional neural networks ( DCNN s) to increase the receptive field and diminish the spatial resolution of feature maps. Dilated or atrous convolutions are designed specifically for the semantic segmentation task to exponentially expand the receptive fields while keeping the number of parameters constant (Yu and Koltun, 2016). Dilated convolutions are convolutional modules with upsampled filters containing zeros between consecutive filter values. Sarker et al. (2018) and Jiang et al. (2019) utilized dilated residual blocks in the encoder to control the image field-of-view explicitly and incorporated multi-scale contextual information into the segmentation network. SkinNet (Vesal et al., 2018b) used dilated convolutions at the lower level of the network to enlarge the field-of-view and capture non-local information. Liu et al. (2019b) introduced dilated convolutions to the U-Net architecture, significantly improving the segmentation performance. Furthermore, di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent versions of the DeepLab architecture (Chen et al., 2017a,b, 2018a), which replace standard convolutions with dilated ones, have been used in skin lesion segmentation (Goyal et al., 2019a,b; Cui et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018b; Canalini et al., 2019).

Separable convolution : Separable convolution or depth-wise separable convolution (Chollet, 2017) is a spatial convolution operation that convolves each input channel with its corresponding kernel. This is followed by a 1 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 1 standard convolution to capture the

<!-- page_break -->

channel-wise dependencies in the output of depth-wise convolution. Depth-wise convolutions are designed to reduce the number of parameters and the computation of standard convolutions while maintaining the accuracy. DSNet (Hasan et al., 2020) and separable-Unet (Tang et al., 2019a) utilized depth-wise separable convolutions in the model to have a lightweight network with a reduced number of parameters. Adopted from the DeepLab architecture, Goyal et al. (2019b), Cui et al. (2019) and, Canalini et al. (2019) incorporated depth-wise separable convolutions in conjunction with dilated convolution to improve the speed and accuracy of dense predictions.

Global convolution : State-of-the-art segmentation models remove densely connected and global pooling layers to preserve spatial information required for full-resolution output recovery. As a result, by keeping high-resolution feature maps, segmentation models become more suitable for localization and, in contrast, less suitable for per-pixel classification, which needs transformation invariant features. To increase the connectivity between feature maps and classifiers, large convolutional kernels should be adopted. However, such kernels have a large number of parameters, which renders them computationally expensive. To tackle this, global convolutional network ( GCN ) modules adopt a combination of symmetric parallel convolutions in the form of 1 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; k + k GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 1 and k GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 1 + 1 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; k to cover a k GLYPH&lt;2&gt; k area of feature maps (Peng et al., 2017b). SeGAN (Xue et al., 2018) employed GCN modules with large kernels in the generator's decoder to reconstruct segmentation masks and in the discriminator architecture to optimally capture a larger receptive field.

Factorized convolution : Factorized convolutions (Wang et al., 2017) are designed to reduce the number of convolution filter parameters as well as the computation time through kernel decomposition when a high-dimensional kernel is substituted with a sequence of lower-dimensional convolutions. Additionally, by adding non-linearity between the composited kernels, the network's capacity may improve. FCA -Net (Singh et al., 2019) and MobileGAN (Sarker et al., 2019) utilized residual 1-D factorized convolutions (a sequence of k GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 1 and 1 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; k convolutions with ReLU non-linearity) in their segmentation architecture.

3.1.1.3. Multi-scale Modules. In FCN s, taking semantic context into account when assigning per-pixel labels leads to a more accurate prediction (Long et al., 2015). Exploiting multi-scale contextual information, e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ectively combining them as well as encoding them in deep semantic segmentation have been widely explored.

Image Pyramid : RefineNet (He et al., 2017) and its extension (He et al., 2018), MSFCDN (Zeng and Zheng, 2018), FCA-Net (Singh et al., 2019), and Abraham and Khan (2019) fed a pyramid of multi-resolution skin lesion images as input to their deep segmentation network to extract multi-scale discriminative features. RefineNet (He et al., 2017, 2018), Factorized channel attention network (FCA-Net (Singh et al., 2019)) and Abraham and Khan (2019) applied convolutional blocks to di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent image resolutions in parallel to generate features which are then up-sampled in order to fuse multi-scale feature maps. Multi-scale fully convolutional DenseNets ( MSFCDN (Zeng and Zheng, 2018)) gradually integrated multi-scale features extracted from the image pyramid into the encoder's down-sampling path. Also, Jafari et al. (2016, 2017) extracted multi-scale patches from clinical images to predict semantic labels and refine lesion boundaries by deploying local and global information. While aggregating the feature maps computed at various image scales improves the segmentation performance, it also increases the computational cost of the network.

Parallel multi-scale convolutions : Alternatively, given a single image resolution, multiple convolutional filters with di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent kernel sizes (Zhang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019a; Jahanifar et al., 2018) or multiple dilated convolutions with di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent dilation

<!-- page_break -->

rates (Goyal et al., 2019a,b; Cui et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018b; Canalini et al., 2019) can be adopted in parallel paths to extract multi-scale contextual features from images. DSM (Zhang et al., 2019a) integrated multi-scale convolutional blocks into the skip connections of an encoder-decoder structure to handle di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent lesion sizes. Wang et al. (2019a) utilized multi-scale convolutional branches in the bottleneck of an encoder-decoder architecture, followed by attention modules to selectively aggregate the extracted multi-scale features.

Pyramid pooling : Another way of incorporating multi-scale information into deep segmentation models is to integrate a pyramid pooling ( PP ) module in the network architecture (Zhao et al., 2017). PP fuses a hierarchy of features extracted from di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent subregions by adopting parallel pooling kernels of various sizes, followed by up-sampling and concatenation to create the final feature maps. Sarker et al. (2018) and Jahanifar et al. (2018) utilized PP in the decoder to benefit from coarse-to-fine features extracted by di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent receptive fields from skin lesion images.

Dilated convolutions and skip connections are two other types of multi-scale information extraction techniques, which are explained in Sections 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.1.1, respectively.

3.1.1.4. Attention Modules. An explicit way to exploit contextual dependencies in the pixel-wise labeling task is the self-attention mechanism (Hu et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2019). Two types of attention modules capture global dependencies in spatial and channel dimensions by integrating features among all positions and channels, respectively. Wang et al. (2019a) and Sarker et al. (2019) leveraged both spatial and channel attention modules to recalibrate the feature maps by examining the feature similarity between pairs of positions or channels and updating each feature value by a weighted sum of all other features. Singh et al. (2019) utilized a channel attention block in the proposed factorized channel attention ( FCA ) blocks, which was used to investigate the correlation of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent channel maps for extraction of relevant patterns. Inspired by attention U-Net (Oktay et al., 2018), multiple works (Abraham and Khan, 2019; Song et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019) integrated a spatial attention gate in an encoder-decoder architecture to combine coarse semantic feature maps and fine localization feature maps. Kaul et al. (2019) proposed FocusNet which utilizes squeeze-and-excitation blocks into a hybrid encoder-decoder architecture. Squeeze-and-excitation blocks model the channel-wise interdependencies to re-weight feature maps and improve their representation power. Experimental results demonstrate that attention modules help the network focus on the lesions and suppress irrelevant feature responses in the background.

3.1.1.5. Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks. Recurrent convolutional neural networks ( RCNN ) integrate recurrent connections into convolutional layers by evolving the recurrent input over time (Pinheiro and Collobert, 2014). Stacking recurrent convolutional layers ( RCL ) on top of the convolutional layer feature extractors ensures capturing spatial and contextual dependencies in images while limiting the network capacity by sharing the same set of parameters in RCL blocks. In the application of skin lesion segmentation, Attia et al. (2017) utilized recurrent layers in the decoder to capture spatial dependencies between deep-encoded features and recover segmentation maps at the original resolution. r N -Net (Alom et al., 2020), RU-Net, and R2U-Net (Alom et al., 2019) incorporated RCL blocks into the FCN architecture to accumulate features across time in a computationally e GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient way and boosted the skin lesion boundary detection. Azad et al. (2019) deployed a non-linear combination of the encoder feature and decoder feature maps by adding a bi-convolutional LSTM BConvLSTM ( ) in skip connections. BConvLSTM consists of two independent convolutional LSTM modules ( ConvLSTMs ) which process the feature maps into two directions of backward and forward

<!-- page_break -->

paths and concatenate their outputs to obtain the final output. Modifications to the traditional pooling layers were also proposed, using a dense pooling strategy (Nasr-Esfahani et al., 2019).


## 3.1.2. Multiple Network Models

Motivations for models comprising more than one DL sub-model are diverse, ranging from alleviating training noise and exploiting a diversity of features learned by di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent models to exploring synergies between multi-task learners. After examining the literature (Fig. 6), we further classified the works in this section into standard ensembles and multi-task models. We also discuss generative adversarial models, which are intrinsically multi-network models, in a separate category.

3.1.2.1. Standard Ensembles. Ensemble models are widely used in machine learning, motivated by the hope that the complementarity of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent models may lead to more stable combined predictions (Sagi and Rokach, 2018). Ensemble performance is contingent on the quality and diversity of the component models, which can be combined at the feature level (early fusion) or the prediction level (late fusion). The former combines the features extracted by the components and learns a meta-model on them, while the latter pools or combines the models' predictions with or without a meta-model.

All methods discussed in this section employ late fusion, except for an approach loosely related to early fusion (Tang et al., 2019a), which explores various learning-rate decay schemes, and builds a single model by averaging the weights learned at di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent epochs to bypass poor local minima during training. Since the weights correspond to features learned by the convolution filters, this approach can be interpreted as feature fusion.

Most works employ a single DL architecture with multiple training routines, varying configurations more or less during training (Canalini et al., 2019). The changes between component models may involve network hyperparameters: number of filters per block and their size (Codella et al., 2017); optimization and regularization hyperparameters: learning rate, weight decay (Tan et al., 2019b); the training set: multiple splits of a training set (Yuan et al., 2017; Yuan and Lo, 2019), separate models per class (Bi et al., 2019b); preprocessing: di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent color spaces (Pollastri et al., 2020); di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent pretraining strategies to initialize feature extractors (Canalini et al., 2019); or di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent ways to initialize the network parameters (Cui et al., 2019). Test-time augmentation may also be seen as a form of inference-time ensembling (Chen et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2019b; Jahanifar et al., 2018) that combines the outputs of multiple augmented images to generate a more reliable prediction.

Bi et al. (2019b) trained a separate DL model for each class, as well as a separate classification model. For inference, the classification model output is used to weight the outputs of the category-specific segmentation networks. In contrast, Soudani and Barhoumi (2019) trained a meta 'recommender' model to dynamically choose, for each input, a segmentation technique from the top five scorers in the ISIC 2017 challenge, although their proposition was validated on a very small test set (10% of ISIC 2017 test set).

Several works also ensemble di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent model architectures for skin lesion segmentation. Goyal et al. (2019b) investigate multiple fusion approaches to avoid severe errors from individual models, comparing the average-, maximum- and minimum-pooling of their outputs. A common assumption is that the component models of the ensemble are trained independently, but Bi et al. (2017b) cascaded the component models, i.e., used the output of one model as the input of the next (in association with the actual image

<!-- page_break -->

input). Thus, each model attempts to refine the segmentation obtained by the previous one. They consider not only the final model output, but all the outputs in the cascade, making the technique a legitimate ensemble.

3.1.2.2. Multi-task Models. Multi-task models jointly address more than one goal, in the hope that synergies among the tasks will improve overall performance (Zhang and Yang, 2022). This can be particularly helpful in medical image analysis, wherein aggregating tasks may alleviate the issue of insu GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient data or annotations. For skin lesions, a few multi-task models exploiting segmentation and classification have been proposed (Chen et al., 2018b; Li and Shen, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020b; Jin et al., 2021).

The synergy between tasks may appear when their models share common relevant features. Li and Shen (2018) assume that all features are shareable between the tasks, and train a single fully convolutional residual network to assign class probabilities at the pixel level. They aggregate the class probability maps to estimate both lesion region and class by weighted averaging of probabilities for di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent classes inside the lesion area. Yang et al. (2018) learn an end-to-end model formed by a shared convolutional feature extractor followed by three task-specific branches (one to segment skin lesions, one to classify them as melanoma versus nonmelanoma, and one to classify them as seborrheic keratosis versus non-seborrheic keratosis.) Similarly, Chen et al. (2018b) add a common feature extractor and separate task heads, and introduce a learnable gate function that controls the flow of information between the tasks to model the latent relationship between two tasks.

Instead of using a single architecture for classification and segmentation, Xie et al. (2020b) and Jin et al. (2021) use three CNNs in sequence to perform a coarse segmentation, followed by classification and, finally, a fine segmentation. Instead of shared features, these works exploit sequential guidance, in which the output of each task improves the learning of the next. While Xie et al. (2020b) feed the output of each network to the next, assuming that the classification network is a diagnostic category and a class activation map (Zhou et al., 2016), Jin et al. (2021) introduce feature entanglement modules, which aggregate features learned by di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent networks.

All multi-task models discussed so far have results suggesting complementarity between classification and segmentation, but there is no clear advantage among these models. The segmentation of dermoscopic features (e.g., networks, globules, regression areas) combined with the other tasks is a promising avenue of research, which could bridge classification and segmentation, by fostering the extraction of features that 'see' the lesion as human specialists do.

We do not consider in the hybrid group, two-stage models in which segmentation is used as ancillary preprocessing to classification (Yu et al., 2017a; Codella et al., 2017; Gonzalez-Diaz, 2018; Al-Masni et al., 2020), since without mutual influence (sharing of losses or features) or feedback between the two tasks, there is no opportunity for synergy.

Vesal et al. (2018a) stressed the importance of object localization as an ancillary task for lesion delineation, in particular deploying FasterRCNN (Ren et al., 2015) to regress a bounding box to crop the lesions before training a SkinNet segmentation model. While this two-stage approach considerably improves the results, it is computationally expensive (a fast nonDL -based bounding box detection algorithm was proposed earlier by Celebi et al. (2009a)). Goyal et al. (2019a) employed ROI detection with a deep extreme cut to extract the extreme points of lesions (leftmost, rightmost, topmost, bottommost pixels) and feed them, in a new auxiliary channel, to a segmentation model.

3.1.2.3. Generative Adversarial Models. We discussed GAN s for synthesizing new samples, their main use in skin lesion analysis, in Section 2.2. In this section, we are interested in GAN s not for generating additional training samples, but for directly providing enhanced segmentation models. Adversarial training encourages high-order consistency in predicted segmentation by implicitly looking into the joint distribution of class labels and ground-truth segmentation masks.

Peng et al. (2019), Tu et al. (2019), Lei et al. (2020), and Izadi et al. (2018) use a U-Net-like generator that takes a dermoscopic image as input, and outputs the corresponding segmentation, while the discriminator is a traditional CNN which attempts to discriminate pairs of image and generated segmentation from pairs of image and ground-truth. The generator has to learn to correctly segment the lesion in order to fool the discriminator. Jiang et al. (2019) use the same scheme, with a dual discriminator. Lei et al. (2020) also employ a second discriminator that takes as input only segmentations (unpaired from input images).

Since the discriminator may trivially learn to recognize the generated masks due to the presence of continuous probabilities, instead of the sharp discrete boundaries of the ground-truths, Wei et al. (2019) and Tu et al. (2019) address this by pre-multiplying both the generated and real segmentations with the (normalized) input images before feeding them to the discriminator.

We discuss adversarial loss functions further in Section 3.2.8.


## 3.1.3. Hybrid Feature Models

Although the major strength of CNN s is their ability to learn meaningful image features without human intervention, a few works tried to combine the best of both worlds, with strategies ranging from employing pre- or postprocessing to enforce prior knowledge to adding hand-crafted features Providing the model with prior knowledge about the expected shape of skin lesionswhich is missing from CNN s-may improve the performance. Mirikharaji and Hamarneh (2018) encode shape information into an additional regularization loss, which penalizes segmentation maps that deviate from a star-shaped prior (Section 3.2.6).

Conditional random fields ( CRF s) use pixel-level color information models to refine the segmentation masks output by the CNN . While both Tschandl et al. (2019) and Adegun and Viriri (2020b) consider a single CNN , Qiu et al. (2020) combine the outputs of multiple CNN s into a single mask, before feeding it together with the input image to the CRF s. ¨ nver and Ayan (2019) U use GrabCut (Rother et al., 2004) to obtain the segmentation mask given the dermoscopy image and a region proposal obtained by the YOLO (Redmon et al., 2016) network. These methods regularize the CNN segmentation, which is mainly based on textural patterns, with expected priors based on the color of the pixels.

Works that combine hand-crafted features with CNN s follow two distinct approaches. The first consists of pre-filtering the input images to increase the contrast between the lesion and the surrounding skin. Techniques explored include local binary patterns ( LBP s) (Ross-Howe and Tizhoosh, 2018; Jayapriya and Jacob, 2020), wavelets (Ross-Howe and Tizhoosh, 2018), Laplacian pyramids (Pour and Seker, 2020), and Laplacian filtering (Saba et al., 2019). The second approach consists of predicting an additional segmentation mask to combine with the one generated by the CNN . Zhang et al. (2019b), for example, use LBP s to consider the textural patterns of skin lesions and guide the networks towards more refined segmentations. Bozorgtabar et al. (2017b) also employ LBP s combined with pixel-level color information to divide the dermoscopic image into superpixels, which are then scored as part of the lesion or the background. The score mask is then combined with the CNN output mask to compute the final segmentation mask. Despite the limited number of works devoted to integrating deep features with hand-crafted ones, the

<!-- page_break -->

results so far indicate that this may be a promising research direction.


## 3.1.4. Transformer Models

Initially proposed for natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), Transformers have proliferated in the last couple of years in other areas, including computer vision applications, especially with improvements made over the years for optimizing the computational cost of self-attention (Parmar et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Cordonnier et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and have consequently also been adapted for semantic segmentation tasks (Ranftl et al., 2021; Strudel et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021). For medical image segmentation, TransUNet (Chen et al., 2021) was one of the first works to use Transformers along with CNNs in the encoder of a U-Net-like encoder-decoder architecture, and Gulzar and Khan (2022) showed that TransUNet outperforms several CNN-only models for skin lesion segmentation. To reduce the computational complexity involved with high-resolution medical images, Cao et al. (2021) proposed the Swin-Unet architecture that uses selfattention within shifted windows (Liu et al., 2021b). For a comprehensive review of the literature of Transformers in general medical image analysis, we refer the interested readers to the surveys by He et al. (2022) and Shamshad et al. (2022).

Zhang et al. (2021b) propose TransFuse which parallelly computes features from CNN and Transformer modules, with the former capturing low-level spatial information and the latter responsible for modeling global context, and these features are then combined using a self-attention-based fusion module. Evaluation on the ISIC 2017 dataset shows superior segmentation performance and faster convergence. The multi-compound Transformer (Ji et al., 2021) leverages Transformer-based self-attention and cross-attention modules between the encoder and the decoder components of U-Net to learn rich features from multi-scale CNN features. Wang et al. (2021a) incorporate boundary-wise prior knowledge in segmentation models using a boundary-aware Transformer (BAT) to deal with the ambiguous boundaries in skin lesion images. More recently, Wu et al. (2022a) introduce a feature-adaptive Transformer network (FAT-Net) that comprised of a dual CNN-Transformer encoder, a light-weight trainable feature-adaptation module, and a memory-e GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient decoder using a squeeze-and-excitation module. The resulting segmentation model is more accurate at segmenting skin lesions while also being faster (fewer parameters and computation) than several CNN-only models.

## Imaging tests

- · Computed Tomography (CT) scan is a safe, noninvasive test that uses an X-ray beam and a computer to make 2-dimensional images of the brain. Similar to an MRI, it views the brain in slices, layer-by-layer, taking a picture of each slice. A dye (contrast agent) may be injected into your bloodstream. CT is especially useful for viewing changes in bony structures.
- · Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is a noninvasive test that uses a magnetic field and radiofrequency waves to give a detailed view of the soft tissues of the brain. It views the brain 3-dimensionally in slices that can be taken from the side or from the top as a crosssection. A dye (contrast agent) may be injected into your bloodstream. MRI is very useful to evaluate brain lesions and their effects on surrounding brain (Fig. 3).


## Biopsy

In some cases, if a diagnosis cannot be made clearly from the scans, a biopsy may be performed to determine what type of tumor is present. Biopsy is a procedure to remove a small amount of tumor to be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. A biopsy can be taken as part of an open surgical procedure to remove the tumor or as a separate diagnostic procedure, known as a needle biopsy via a small hole drilled in the skull. A hollow needle is guided into the tumor and a tissue sample is removed (Fig. 4). A stereotactic biopsy is like a needle biopsy but is performed with the use of a stereotactic head frame and a computer to precisely locate the tumor and direct the needle. This more complex procedure is used for deep tumors in critical locations.

## 2. Input Data

Obtaining data in su GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient quantity and quality is often a significant obstacle to developing e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ective segmentation models. State-of-the-art segmentation models have a huge number of adjustable parameters that allow them to generalize well, provided they are trained on massive labeled datasets (Sun et al., 2017; Buslaev et al., 2020). Unfortunately, skin lesion datasets-like most medical image datasets (Asgari Taghanaki et al., 2021)-tend to be small (Curiel-Lewandrowski et al., 2019) due to issues such as copyright, patient privacy, acquisition and annotation cost, standardization, and scarcity of many pathologies of interest. The two most common modalities used in the training of skin lesion segmentation models are clinical images , which are close-ups of the lesions acquired using conventional cameras, and dermoscopic images , which are acquired using dermoscopy, a non-invasive skin imaging through optical magnification, and either liquid immersion and low angle-of-incidence lighting, or cross-polarized lighting. Dermoscopy eliminates skin surface reflections (Kittler et al., 2002), reveals subsurface skin structures, and allows the identification of dozens of morphological features such as atypical pigment networks, dots globules, streaks, blue-white areas, and / blotches (Menzies et al., 2003).

Annotation is often the greatest barrier for increasing the amount of data. Objective evaluation of segmentation often requires laborious region-based annotation , in which an expert manually outlines the region where the lesion (or a clinical feature) appears in

the image. By contrast, textual annotation may involve diagnosis (e.g., melanoma, carcinoma, benign nevi), presence absence score / / of dermoscopic features (e.g., pigment networks, blue-white areas, streaks, globules), diagnostic strategy (e.g., pattern analysis, ABCD rule, 7-point checklist, 3-point checklist), clinical metadata (e.g., sex, age, anatomic site, familial history), and other details (e.g., timestamp, camera model) (Ca GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ery et al., 2018). We extensively discuss the image annotation issue in Section 4.1.


## 2.1. Datasets

The availability of larger, more diverse, and better-annotated datasets is one of the main driving factors for the advances in skin image analysis in the past decade (Marchetti et al., 2018; Celebi et al., 2019). Works in skin image analysis date back to the 1980s (Vanker and Van Stoecker, 1984; Dhawan et al., 1984), but until the mid-2000s, these works used small, private datasets, containing a few hundred images.

The Interactive Atlas of Dermoscopy (sometimes called the Edra Atlas , in reference to the publisher) by Argenziano et al. (2000) included a CD-ROM with 1 039 dermoscopy images (26% melanomas, 4% carcinomas, 70% nevi) of 1 024 ; ; GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 683 pixels, acquired by three European university hospitals (University of Graz, Austria, University of Naples, Italy, and University of Florence, Italy). The works of Celebi et al. (2007b, 2008) popularized the dataset in the dermoscopy image analysis community, where it became a de facto evaluation standard for almost a decade, until the much larger ISIC Archive datasets (see below) became available. Recently, Kawahara et al. (2019) placed this valuable dataset, along with additional textual annotations based on the 7-point checklist, in public domain under the name derm7pt . Shortly after the publication of the Interactive Atlas of Dermoscopy, Menzies et al. (2003) published An Atlas of Surface Microscopy of Pigmented Skin Lesions: Dermoscopy , with a CD-ROM containing 217 dermoscopic images (39% melanomas, 7% carcinomas, 54% nevi) of 712 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 454 pixels, acquired at the Sydney Melanoma Unit, Australia.

The PH 2 dataset, released by Mendonca et al. (2013) and detailed by Mendonca et al. (2015), was the first public dataset to provide region-based annotations with segmentation masks, and masks for the clinically significant colors (white, red, light brown, dark brown, blue-gray, and black) present in the images. The dataset contains 200 dermoscopic images (20% melanomas, 40% atypical nevi, and 40% common nevi) of 768 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 560 pixels, acquired at the Hospital Pedro Hispano, Portugal. The Edinburgh DermoFit Image Library (Ballerini et al., 2013) also provides region-based annotations for 1 ; 300 clinical images (10 diagnostic categories including melanomas, seborrhoeic keratosis, and basal cell carcinoma) of sizes ranging from 177 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 189 to 2 ; 176 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 2 549 ; pixels. The images were acquired with a Canon EOS 350D SLR camera, in controlled lighting and at a consistent distance from the lesions, resulting in a level of quality atypical for clinical images.

The ISIC Archive contains the world's largest curated repository of dermoscopic images. ISIC , an international academiaindustry partnership sponsored by ISDIS (International Society for Digital Imaging of the Skin), aims to 'facilitate the application of digital skin imaging to help reduce melanoma mortality' (ISIC, 2023). At the time of writing, the archive contains more than 240 000 images, of which more than 71 000 are publicly available. ; ; These images were acquired in leading worldwide clinical centers, using a variety of devices.

In addition to curating the datasets that collectively form the ' ISIC Archive', ISIC has released standard archive subsets as part of its Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge, organized annually since 2016. The 2016, 2017, and 2018 challenges comprised segmentation, feature extraction, and classification tasks, while the 2019 and 2020 challenges featured

only classification. Each subset is associated with a challenge (year), one or more tasks, and has two (training test) or three / (training validation test) splits. / / The ISIC Challenge 2016 (Gutman et al., 2016) ( ISIC 2016, for brevity) contains 1 ; 279 images split into 900 for training (19% melanomas, 81% nevi), and 379 for testing (20% melanomas, 80% nevi). There is a large variation in image size, ranging from 0 5 to 12 megapixels. : All tasks used the same images. The ISIC 2017 (Codella et al., 2018) dataset more than doubled, with 2 750 images split into 2 ; ; 000 for training (18 7% melanomas, 12 7% seborrheic keratoses, 68 6% nevi), : : : 150 for validation (20% melanomas, 28% seborrheic keratoses, 52% nevi), and 600 for testing (19 5% melanomas, 15% seborrheic : keratoses, 65 5% nevi). Again, image size varied markedly, ranging from 0 5 to 29 megapixels, and all tasks used the same images. : :

ISIC 2018 provided, for the first time, separate datasets for the tasks, with 2 ; 594 training (20% melanomas, 72% nevi, and 8% seborrheic keratoses) and 100 1 / ; 000 for validation test images ranging from 0 5 to 29 megapixels, for the tasks of segmentation and / : feature extraction (Codella et al., 2019), and 10 ; 015 1 512 training test images for the classification task, all with 600 / ; / GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 450 pixels. The training dataset for classification was the HAM10000 dataset (Tschandl et al., 2018), acquired over a period of 20 years at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria and the private practice of Dr. Cli GLYPH&lt;11&gt; Rosendahl, Australia. It allowed a five-fold increase in training images in comparison to 2017 and comprised seven diagnostic categories: melanoma (11 1%), nevus (66 9%), basal : : cell carcinoma (5 1%), actinic keratosis or Bowen's disease (3 3%), benign keratosis (solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis, or lichen : : planus-like keratosis, 11%), dermatofibroma (1 1%), and vascular lesion (1 4%). : : As a part of a 2020 study of human-computer collaboration for skin lesion diagnosis involving dermatologists and general practitioners (Tschandl et al., 2020), the lesions in the HAM10000 dataset were segmented by a single dermatologist and consequently released publicly (ViDIR Dataverse, 2020), making this the single largest publicly available skin lesion segmentation dataset (Table 1).

ISIC 2019 (Codella et al., 2018; Tschandl et al., 2018; Combalia et al., 2019) contains 25 ; 331 training images (18% melanomas, 51% nevi, 13% basal cell carcinomas, 3 5% actinic keratoses, 10% benign keratoses, 1% dermatofibromas, 1% vascular lesions, : and 2 5% squamous cell carcinomas) and 8 238 test images (diagnostic distribution unknown). The images range from 600 : ; GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 450 to 1 ; 024 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 1 024 pixels. ;

ISIC 2020 (Rotemberg et al., 2021) contains 33 126 training images (1 8% melanomas, 97 6% nevi, 0 4% seborrheic ker-; : : : atoses, 0 1% lentigines simplex, 0 1% lichenoid keratoses, 0 02% solar lentigines, 0 003% cafe-au-lait macules, 0 003% atypical : : : : : melanocytic proliferations) and 10 ; 982 test images (diagnostic distribution unknown), ranging from 0.5 to 24 megapixels. Multiple centers, distributed worldwide, contributed to the dataset, including the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ( USA ), the Melanoma Institute, the Sydney Melanoma Diagnostic Centre, and the University of Queensland (Australia), the Medical University of Vienna (Austria), the University of Athens (Greece), and the Hospital Clinic Barcelona (Spain). An important novelty in this dataset is the presence of multiple lesions per patient, with the express motivation of exploiting intra- and inter-patient lesion patterns, e.g., the so-called 'ugly-ducklings', lesions whose appearances are atypical for a given patient, and which present an increased risk of malignancy (Gachon et al., 2005).

There is, however, an overlap among these ISIC Challenge datasets. Abhishek (2020) analyzed all the lesion segmentation datasets from the ISIC Challenges (2016-2018) and found considerable overlap between these 3 datasets, with as many as 1 940 ; images shared between at least 2 datasets and 706 images shared between all 3 datasets. In a more recent analysis of the ISIC Challenge datasets for the lesion diagnosis task from 2016 through 2020, Cassidy et al. (2022) found overlap between the datasets as well as the presence of duplicates within the datasets. Using a duplicate removal strategy, they curated a new set of 45 ; 590 training images (8 61% melanomas, 91 39% others) and 11 397 validation images (8 61% melanomas, 91 39% others), leading : : ; : : to a total of 56 ; 987 images. Additionally, since the resulting dataset is highly imbalanced (melanomas versus others in a ratio of 1 : 10 62), the authors also curated a balanced dataset with 7 : ; 848 training images (50% melanoma, 50% others) and 1 962 ; validation images (50% melanoma, 50% others).

Table 1 shows a list of publicly available skin lesion datasets with pixel-wise annotations, image modality, sample size, original split sizes, and diagnostic distribution. Fig. 3 shows how frequently these datasets appear in the literature. It is also worth noting that several other skin lesion image datasets have not been described in our survey as they do not provide the corresponding skin lesion segmentation annotations. However, these datasets, including SD-198 (Sun et al., 2016), MED-NODE (Giotis et al., 2015), derm7pt (Kawahara et al., 2019), Interactive Dermatology Atlas (Usatine and Madden, 2013), Dermatology Information System (DermIS, 2012), DermWeb (Lui et al., 2009), DermNet New Zealand (Oakley et al., 1995), may still be relevant for skin lesion segmentation research (see Section 5).

Biases in computer vision datasets are a constant source of issues (Torralba and Efros, 2011), which is compounded in medical imaging due to the smaller number of samples, insu GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient image resolution, lack of geographical or ethnic diversity, or statistics unrepresentative of clinical practice. All existing skin lesion datasets su GLYPH&lt;11&gt; er to a certain extent from one or more of the aforementioned issues, to which we add the specific issue of the availability and reliability of annotations. For lesion classification, many

Fig. 3: The frequency of utilization of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent skin lesion segmentation datasets in the surveyed studies. We found that 82 papers evaluated on more than 1 dataset, with 36 papers opting for cross-dataset evaluation ( CDE in Table 3). ISIC datasets ( ISIC 2016, ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and ISIC Archive) are used in the majority of papers, with 168 of 177 papers using at least one ISIC dataset and the ISIC 2017 dataset being the most popular (117 papers). The PH 2 dataset is the second most widely used (56 papers) following ISIC datasets.

picture_counter_12 The image is a pie chart depicting the distribution of different datasets used in a study. The datasets and their respective proportions are:

- ISIC 2017: 39.4%
- ISIC 2018: 21.2%
- PH²: 18.9%
- ISIC 2016: 13.8%
- DermoFit: 2.4%
- DermQuest: 2.0%

samples lack the gold standard histopathological confirmation, and ground-truth segmentation, even when available, is inherently noisy (Section 4.2). The presence of artifacts (Fig. 1) may lead to spurious correlations, an issue that Bissoto et al. (2019) attempted to quantify for classification models.


## 2.2. Synthetic Data Generation

Data augmentation-synthesizing new samples from existing ones-is commonly employed in the training of DL models. Augmented data serve as a regularizer, increase the amount and diversity of data (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019), induce desirable invariances on the model, and alleviate class imbalance. Traditional data augmentation applies simple geometric, photometric, and colorimetric transformations on the samples, including mirroring, translation, scaling, rotation, cropping, random region erasing, a GLYPH&lt;14&gt; ne or elastic deformation, modifications of hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast. Usually, several transformations are chosen at random and combined. Fig. 4 exemplifies the procedure, as applied to a dermoscopic image with Albumentations (Buslaev et al., 2020), a state-of-the-art open-source library for image augmentation.

As mentioned earlier, augmented training data induce invariance on the models: random translations and croppings, for example, help induce a translation-invariant model. This has implications for skin lesion analysis, e.g., data augmentation for generic datasets (such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009)) forgo vertical mirroring and large-angle rotations, because natural scenes have a strong vertical anisotropy, while skin lesion images are isotropic. In addition, augmented test data (test-time augmentation) may also improve generalization by combining the predictions of several augmented samples through, for example, average pooling or majority voting (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Perez et al. (2018) have systematically evaluated the e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ect of several data

<!-- page_break -->

augmentation schemes for skin lesion classification, finding that the use of both training and test augmentation is critical for performance, surpassing, in some cases, increases of real data without augmentation. Valle et al. (2020) found, in a very large-scale experiment, that test-time augmentation was the second most influential factor for classification performance, after training set size. No systematic study of this kind exists for skin lesion segmentation.

Although traditional data augmentation is crucial for training DL models, it falls short of providing samples that are both diverse and plausible from the same distribution as real data. Thus, modern data augmentation (Tajbakhsh et al., 2020a) employs generative modeling, learning the probability distribution of the real data, and sampling from that distribution. Generative adversarial networks ( GAN s) (Goodfellow et al., 2020) are the most promising approach in this direction (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019), especially for medical image analysis (Yi et al., 2019; Kazeminia et al., 2020; Shamsolmoali et al., 2021). GAN s employ an adversarial training between a generator, which attempts to generate realistic fake samples, and a discriminator, which attempts to di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erentiate real samples from fake ones. When the procedure converges, the generator output is surprisingly convincing, but GAN s are computationally expensive and di GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cult to train (Creswell et al., 2018).

Synthetic generation of skin lesions has received some recent interest, especially in the context of improving classification. Works can be roughly divided into those that use GAN s to create new images from a Gaussian latent variable (Baur et al., 2018; Pollastri et al., 2020; Abdelhalim et al., 2021), and those that implement GAN s based on image-to-image translation (Abhishek and Hamarneh, 2019; Bissoto et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2021).

Noise-based GAN s, such as DCGAN (Yu et al., 2017b), LAPGAN (Denton et al., 2015), and PGAN (Karras et al., 2018), learn to decode a Gaussian latent variable into an image that belongs to the training set distribution. The main advantage of these techniques

<!-- page_break -->

is the ability to create more, and more diverse images, as, in principle, any sample from a multivariate Gaussian distribution may become a di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent image. The disadvantage is that the images tend to be of lower quality, and, in the case of segmentation, one needs to generate plausible pairs of images and segmentation masks.

Image-to-image translation GAN s, such as pix2pix (Isola et al., 2017) and pix2pixHD (Wang et al., 2018), learn to create new samples from a semantic segmentation map. They have complementary advantages and disadvantages. Because the procedure is deterministic (one map creates one image), they have much less freedom in the number of samples available, but the images tend to be of higher quality (or more 'plausible'). There is no need to generate separate segmentation maps because the generated image is intrinsically compatible with the input segmentation map.

The two seminal papers on GAN s for skin lesions (Baur et al., 2018; Bissoto et al., 2018) evaluate several models. Baur et al. (2018) compare the noise-based DCGAN LAPGAN , , and PGAN for the generation of 256 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 256-pixel images using both qualitative and quantitative criteria, finding that the PGAN gives considerably better results. They further examine the PGAN against a panel of human judges, composed by dermatologists and DL experts, in a 'visual Turing test', showing that both had di GLYPH&lt;14&gt; culties in distinguishing the fake images from the true ones. Bissoto et al. (2018) adapt the PGAN to be class-conditioned on diagnostic category, and the image-to-image pix2pixHD to employ the semantic annotation provided by the feature extraction task of the ISIC 2018 dataset (Section 1), comparing those to an unmodified DCGAN on 256 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 256-pixel images, and finding the modified pix2pixHD to be qualitatively better. They use the performance improvement on a separate classification network as a quantitative metric, finding that the use of samples from both PGAN and pix2pixHD leads to the best improvements. They also showcase images of size up to 1 ; 024 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 1 024 pixels generated by the pix2pixHD-derived model. ;

Pollastri et al. (2020) extended DCGAN and LAPGAN architectures to generate the segmentation masks (in the pairwise scheme explained above), making their work the only noise-based GAN s usable for segmentation to date. Bi et al. (2019a) introduced stacked adversarial learning to GAN s to learn class-specific skin lesion image generators given the ground-truth segmentations. Abhishek and Hamarneh (2019) employ pix2pix to translate a binary segmentation mask into a dermoscopic image and use the generated image-mask pairs to augment skin lesion segmentation training datasets, improving segmentation performance.

Ding et al. (2021) feed a segmentation mask and an instance mask to a conditional GAN generator, where the instance mask states the diagnostic category to be synthesized. In both cases, the discriminator receives di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent resolutions of the generated image and is required to make a decision for each of them. Abdelhalim et al. (2021) is a recent work that also conditions PGAN on the class label and uses the generated outputs to augment a melanoma diagnosis dataset.

Recently, Bissoto et al. (2021) cast doubt on the power of GAN -synthesized data augmentation to reliably improve skin lesion classification. Their evaluation, which included four GAN models, four datasets, and several augmentation scenarios, showed improvement only in a severe cross-modality scenario (training on dermoscopic and testing on clinical images). To the best of our knowledge, no corresponding systematic evaluation exists for skin lesion segmentation.


## 2.3. Supervised, Semi-supervised, Weakly supervised, Self-supervised learning

Although supervised DL has achieved outstanding performance in various medical image analysis applications, its dependency on high-quality annotations limits its applicability, as well as its generalizability to unseen, out-of-distribution data. Semi-supervised

<!-- page_break -->

Fig. 5: A breakdown of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent levels of supervision used in the 177 surveyed works. Fully supervised models continue to make up the majority of the literature (163 papers), with semi-supervised and weakly supervised methods appearing in only 9 papers. Self-supervision in skin lesion segmentation is fairly new, with all the 5 papers appearing from 2020 onwards.

picture_counter_19 The image is a pie chart depicting the distribution of different types of learning methods used in diagnosing diseases. The chart shows that 92.1% of the methods are fully-supervised, 5.1% are semi- and weakly-supervised, and 2.8% are self-supervised.

techniques attempt to learn from both labeled and unlabeled samples. Weakly supervised techniques attempt to exploit partial annotations like image-level labels or bounding boxes, often in conjunction with a subset of pixel-level fully-annotated samples.

Since pixel-level annotation of skin lesion images is costly, there is a trade-o GLYPH&lt;11&gt; between annotation precision and e GLYPH&lt;14&gt; ciency. In practice, the annotations are intrinsically noisy, which can be modeled explicitly to avoid over-fitting. (We discuss the issue of annotation variability in Section 4.2.) To deal with label noise, Mirikharaji et al. (2019) learn a model robust to annotation noise, making use of a large set of unreliable annotations and a small set of perfect clean annotations. They propose to learn a spatially adaptive weight map corresponding to each training data, assigning di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent weights to noisy and clean pixel-level annotations while training the deep model. To remove the dependency on having a set of perfectly clean annotations, Redekop and Chernyavskiy (2021) propose to alter noisy ground-truth masks during training by considering the quantification of aleatoric uncertainty (Der Kiureghian and Ditlevsen, 2009; Gal, 2016; Depeweg et al., 2018; Kwon et al., 2020) to obtain a map of regions of high and low uncertainty. Pixels of ground-truth masks in highly uncertain regions are flipped, progressively increasing the model's robustness to label noise. Ribeiro et al. (2020) deal with noise by discarding inconsistent samples and annotation detail during training time, showing that the model generalizes better even when detailed annotations are required in test time.

When there is a labeled dataset, even if the number of labeled samples is far less than that of unlabeled samples, semi- and self-supervision techniques can be applied. Li et al. (2021c) propose a semi-supervised approach, using a transformation-consistent self-ensemble to leverage unlabeled data and to regularize the model. They minimize the di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erence between the network predictions of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent transformations (random perturbations, flipping, and rotation) applied to the input image and the transformation of the model prediction for the input image. Self-supervision attempts to exploit intrinsic labels by solving proxy tasks, enabling the use

<!-- page_break -->

of a large, unlabeled corpus of data to pretrain a model before fine-tuning it on the target task. An example is to artificially apply random rotations in the input images, and train the model to predict the exact degree of rotation (Gidaris et al., 2018). Note that the degree of rotation of each image is known, since it was artificially applied, and thus, can be used as a label during training. Similarly, for skin lesion segmentation, Li et al. (2020b) propose to exploit the color distribution information, the proxy task being to predict values from blue and red color channels while having the green one as input. They also include a task to estimate the red and blue color distributions to improve the model's ability to extract global features. After the pretraining, they use a smaller set of labeled data to fine-tune the model.


## 2.4. Image Preprocessing

Preprocessing may facilitate the segmentation of skin lesion images. Typical preprocessing operations include:

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Downsampling : Dermoscopy is typically a high-resolution technique, resulting in large image sizes, while many convolutional neural network ( CNN ) architectures, e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, VGG , GoogLeNet, ResNet, etc., require fixed-size input images, usually 224 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 224 or 299 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 299 pixels, and even those CNN s that can handle arbitrary-sized images (e.g., fullyconvolutional networks ( FCN s)) may benefit from downsampling for computational reasons. Downsampling is common in the skin lesion segmentation literature (Codella et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017a; Yuan et al., 2017; Al-Masni et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b; Pollastri et al., 2020).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Color space transformations : RGB images are expected by most models, but some works (Codella et al., 2017; Al-Masni et al., 2018; Yuan and Lo, 2019; Pollastri et al., 2020; Pour and Seker, 2020) employ alternative color spaces (Busin et al., 2008), such as CIELAB CIELUV , , and HSV . Often, one or more channels of the transformed space are combined with the RGB channels for reasons including, but not limited to, increasing the class separability, decoupling luminance and chromaticity, ensuring (approximate) perceptual uniformity, achieving invariance to illumination or viewpoint, and eliminating highlights.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Additional inputs : In addition to color space transformations, recent works incorporate more focused and domain-specific inputs to the segmentation models, such as Fourier domain representation using the discrete Fourier transform (Tang et al., 2021b) and inputs based on the physics of skin illumination and imaging (Abhishek et al., 2020).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Contrast enhancement : Insu GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient contrast (Fig. 1(i)) is a prime reason for segmentation failures (Bogo et al., 2015), leading some works (Saba et al., 2019; Schaefer et al., 2011) to enhance the image contrast prior to segmentation.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Color normalization : Varying illumination (Barata et al., 2015a,b) may lead to inconsistencies in skin lesion segmentation. This problem can be addressed by color normalization (Goyal et al., 2019b).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Artifact removal : Dermoscopic images often present artifacts, among which hair (Fig. 1(g)) is the most distracting (Abbas et al., 2011), leading some studies ( ¨ nver and Ayan, 2019; Zafar et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021b) to remove it prior to U segmentation.

Classical machine learning models (e.g., nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines (Celebi et al., 2007b, 2008; Iyatomi et al., 2008; Barata et al., 2014; Shimizu et al., 2015)), which rely on hand-crafted features (Barata et al., 2019), tend

<!-- page_break -->

to benefit more from preprocessing than DL models, which, when properly trained, can learn from the data how to bypass input issues (Celebi et al., 2015a; Valle et al., 2020). However, preprocessing may still be helpful when dealing with small or noisy datasets.

## COVID-ͷ9 detection from chest X-ray images using transfer learning

Enas M. F. El Houby

COVID-ͷ9 is a kind of coronavirus that appeared in China in the Province of Wuhan in December ͸Ͷͷ9. The most significant influence of this virus is its very highly contagious characteristic which may lead to death. The standard diagnosis of COVID-ͷ9 is based on swabs from the throat and nose, their sensitivity is not high enough and so they are prone to errors. Early diagnosis of COVID-ͷ9 disease is important to provide the chance of quick isolation of the suspected cases and to decrease the opportunity of infection in healthy people. In this research, a framework for chest X-ray image classification tasks based on deep learning is proposed to help in early diagnosis of COVID-ͷ9. The proposed framework contains two phases which are the pre-processing phase and classification phase which uses pre-trained convolution neural network models based on transfer learning. In the pre-processing phase, different image enhancements have been applied to full and segmented X-ray images to improve the classification performance of the CNN models. Two CNN pre-trained models have been used for classification which are VGGͷ9 and EfficientNetBͶ. From experimental results, the best model achieved a sensitivity of Ͷ.9ͼ, specificity of Ͷ.9ͺ, precision of Ͷ.9ͺͷ͸, Fͷ score of Ͷ.9ͻͶͻ and accuracy of Ͷ.9ͻ using enhanced full X-ray images for binary classification of chest X-ray images into COVID-ͷ9 or normal with VGGͷ9. The proposed framework is promising and achieved a classification accuracy of Ͷ.9͹ͻ for ͺ-class classification.

Since December 2019, coronavirus has been disseminated from China to many other countries. Coronavirus which is called SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 as named by World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020. World Health Organization announced COVID-19 disease resulted from the coronavirus as a world pandemic in March   2020 . The disease has disseminated to nearly all countries, resulting in millions of people's 1 deaths among confirmed cases based on the statistics of the   WHO . By July 2023, nearly 700 million confirmed 2 cases, and almost 7 million confirmed deaths were recorded in the   world 3,4 . Most patients with the virus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and heal without needing special treatment. But, some suffer from complications and need medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any   age . 5

Although the last diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, in states of people with intensive respiratory symptoms the diagnosis protocol depends on medical imaging, which helps doctors to recognize the disease as the sensitivity of PCR is strongly   variable . As chest radiography 6 imaging such as computed tomography (CT) imaging and X-ray have been used successfully for the diagnosis of pneumonia, they have a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 . The suspected case undergoes an X-Ray 2 session and if more details are required, a computed tomography scan (CT-scan) session is taken. Therefore, X-ray 7 and CT scan   images  are being used as diagnostic methods for COVID-19 and to detect the   effects  of the 8 9 virus 6,10 . The availability and accessibility of X-ray imaging in many imaging centers and clinics is more present even in rural regions as it is standard equipment in healthcare systems. Particularly, chest X-ray is more readily available than CT, because CT scanners require high equipment and maintenance costs. CT is not very suitable for COVID-19 screening as well because of its cost, imaging time, and radiation exposure whereas X-ray is more cost and time effective in dealing with such a common   virus 11 .

The abnormalities can only be explained by expert radiologists. With the huge number of suspected cases and the limited number of available radiologists, automatic methodologies for the recognition of these precise abnormalities can aid in early diagnosis with high accuracy. The studies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, especially Deep Learning (DL), achieved high performance in the diagnosis of medical images. Therefore, DL techniques are robust tools for such issues.

Deep learning (DL) has been successfully used to predict COVID-19 from Chest images. Unlike the traditional machine learning techniques DL can be used to predict disease from raw images without feature extraction required. The role of deep learning is to learn the features using a trained model with a huge amount of data to improve the classification's accuracy which reduces the burden on physicians and decreases the effect of doctors' shortages of the struggle against the disease. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is the type of DL model intended for image analysis tasks and has already been utilized in many medical problems such as segmentation and   classification 12 .

Many high-performing pre-trained CNN structures have been provided in the literature to be utilized in similar problems. These models were trained using ImageNet data which contains 1,000,000 images and 1000 classes to overcome the limitation of data and to reduce the training   time 13 . These models can be used for image recognition based on transfer learning after fine-tuning these networks to the new problems. The learned weights of these pre-trained models are provided and used directly in the new   problems 14 . The purpose of utilizing pretrained models is to take advantage of learned features on a larger dataset, therefore the new model can converge faster and perform better with a smaller dataset. This gives us the advantage of DL independence of feature engineering over traditional methods without giving up the time, computational resources and cost effeciencies. Examples of these pre-trained CNN models are visual geometry group VGG (16, 19) 15 , EfficientNet (B0 to B7) 16 , MobileNet 17 , and residual neural network (ResNet) 18 , etc.

The contributions of this research can be summarized as follows:

- · A framework has been developed to diagnose COVID-19 using chest X-ray images for both full and segmented images.
- · A multiplication between each original image and the associated lung mask from the ground truth dataset provided by the database has been applied to get the segmented lung.
- · Different image enhancement techniques have been applied to both full and segmented X-ray images to reach the best possible classification performance.
- · CNN pre-trained models based on transfer learning have been used to classify both full and segmented chest X-ray images with all enhancement versions and achieved promising results.
- · Since the purpose of utilizing pre-trained models is to take advantage of learned features on a larger dataset, therefore the smallest possible datasets that can achieve the best possible performance have been used for faster convergence.

Recently, many works have been developed to detect and diagnose COVID-19 and other lung diseases based on different medical image modalities using different machine learning techniques especially deep learning and transfer learning techniques. The purpose of all these works is to improve the performances of the methodologies used in the detection and classification of COVID-19 and other lung diseases. The focus in the research will be in X-ray images as the adopted medical image modality in this research.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related COVID-19 articles using deep learning are reviewed in the 'Related work' section. Then, the proposed framework for COVID-19 classification is described in "The proposed framework" section. Next, the results of X-ray images obtained with the proposed framework are presented in "Experimental results" section. The discussion and comparison with literature are provided in "Discussion" section. Finally, the main 'Conclusions and future work' are outlined.

Article history :

Skin cancer is a major public health problem that could benefit from computer-aided diagnosis to reduce the burden of this common disease. Skin lesion segmentation from images is an important step toward achieving this goal. However, the presence of natural and artificial artifacts (e.g., hair and air bubbles), intrinsic factors (e.g., lesion shape and contrast), and variations in image acquisition conditions make skin lesion segmentation a challenging task. Recently, various researchers have explored the applicability of deep learning models to skin lesion segmentation. In this survey, we cross-examine 177 research papers that deal with deep learning-based segmentation of skin lesions. We analyze these works along several dimensions, including input data (datasets, preprocessing, and synthetic data generation), model design (architecture, modules, and losses), and evaluation aspects (data annotation requirements and segmentation performance). We discuss these dimensions both from the viewpoint of select seminal works, and from a systematic viewpoint, examining how those choices have influenced current trends, and how their limitations should be addressed. To facilitate comparisons, we summarize all examined works in a comprehensive table as well as an interactive table available online 1 .

## 1. Introduction

Segmentation is a challenging and critical operation in the automated skin lesion analysis workflow. Shape information, such as size, symmetry, border definition and irregularity are important criteria for diagnosing skin cancer. Both surgical excision and radiation therapy require localization and delineation of lesions (American Cancer Society, 2023). Manual delineation is a laborious task su GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ering from significant inter- and intra-observer variability. A fast and reliable segmentation algorithm is thus an integral

part of an e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ective computer-aided diagnosis ( CAD ) system for skin cancer. In addition to serving as an intermediate step in several CAD systems, including as a pre-processing step when analyzing wide-field images with multiple lesions (Birkenfeld et al., 2020), and enhancing the explainability and the robustness of diagnosis methods (Jaworek-Korjakowska et al., 2021), recent studies show the utility of segmentation in improving the classification performance for certain diagnostic categories by regularizing attention maps (Yan et al., 2019), allowing the cropping of lesion images (Mahbod et al., 2020), and the removal of imaging artifacts (Maron et al., 2021a; Bissoto et al., 2022). Moreover, rule-based diagnostic systems, such as ABCD (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter of lesions) (Friedman et al., 1985; Nachbar et al., 1994) and its derivatives: ABCDE ABCD ( plus Evolution of lesions) (Abbasi et al., 2004) and ABCDEF ABCDE ( plus the 'ugly duckling' sign) (Jensen and Elewski, 2015), rely on an accurate lesion segmentation for the estimation of diagnostic criteria such as asymmetry, border irregularity, lesion size, etc..

Skin cancer and its associated expenses, $8 1 billion annually in U.S. (Guy Jr et al., 2015), have grown into a major public : health issue in the past decades. In the USA alone, 97 610 new cases of melanoma are expected in 2023 (Siegel et al., 2023). ; Broadly speaking, there are two types of skin cancer: melanomas and non-melanomas, the former making up just 1% of the cases, but the majority of the deaths due to its aggressiveness. Early diagnosis is critical for a good prognosis: melanoma can be cured with a simple outpatient surgery if detected early, but its five-year survival rate drops from over 99% to 32% if it is diagnosed at an advanced stage (American Cancer Society, 2023).

Two imaging modalities are commonly employed in automated skin lesion analysis (Daneshjou et al., 2022): dermoscopic (microscopic) images and clinical (macroscopic) images. While dermoscopic images allow the inspection of lesion properties that are invisible to the naked eye, they are not always accessible even to dermatologists (Engasser and Warshaw, 2010). On the other hand, clinical images acquired using conventional cameras are easily accessible but su GLYPH&lt;11&gt; er from lower quality. Dermoscopy is a non-invasive skin imaging technique that aids in the diagnosis of skin lesions by allowing dermatologists to visualize sub-surface structures (Kittler et al., 2002). However, even with dermoscopy, diagnostic accuracy can vary widely, ranging from 24% to 77%, depending on the clinician's level of expertise (Tran et al., 2005). Moreover, dermoscopy may actually lower the diagnostic accuracy in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists (Binder et al., 1995). Therefore, to minimize the diagnostic errors that result from the di GLYPH&lt;14&gt; culty and the subjectivity of visual interpretation and to reduce the burden of skin diseases and limited access to dermatologists, the development of CAD systems is crucial.

Segmentation is the partitioning of an image into meaningful regions. Semantic segmentation, in particular, assigns appropriate class labels to each region. For skin lesions, the task is almost always binary, separating the lesion from the surrounding skin. Automated skin lesion segmentation is hindered by illumination and contrast issues, intrinsic inter-class similarities and intra-class variability, occlusions, artifacts, and the diversity of imaging tools used. The lack of large datasets with ground-truth segmentation masks generated by experts compounds the problem, impeding both the training of models and their reliable evaluation. Skin lesion images are occluded by natural artifacts such as hair (Fig. 1(a)), blood vessels (Fig. 1(b)), and artificial ones such as surgical marker annotations (Fig. 1(c)), lens artifacts (dark corners) (Fig. 1(d)), and air bubbles (Fig. 1(e)). Intrinsic factors such as lesion size and shape variation (Fig. 1(f) and 1(g)), di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent skin colors (Fig. 1(h)), low contrast (Fig. 1(i)), and ambiguous boundaries (Fig. 1(h)) complicate the automated segmentation of skin lesions.

Before the deep learning ( DL ) revolution, segmentation was based on classical image processing and machine learning tech-

niques such as adaptive thresholding (Green et al., 1994; Celebi et al., 2013), active contours (Erkol et al., 2005), region growing (Iyatomi et al., 2006; Celebi et al., 2007a), unsupervised clustering (G´mez et al., 2007), and support vector machines (Zortea o et al., 2011). These approaches depend on hand-crafted features, which are di GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cult to engineer and often limit invariance and discriminative power from the outset. As a result, such conventional segmentation algorithms do not always perform well on larger and more complex datasets. In contrast, DL integrates feature extraction and task-specific decision seamlessly, and does not just cope with, but actually requires larger datasets.

Survey of surveys. Celebi et al. (2009b) reviewed 18 skin lesion segmentation algorithms for dermoscopic images, published between 1998 and 2008, with their required preprocessing and postprocessing steps. Celebi et al. (2015b) later extended their work with 32 additional algorithms published between 2009 and 2014, discussing performance evaluation and computational requirements of each approach, and suggesting guidelines for future works. Both surveys appeared before DL was widely adopted for skin lesion segmentation, but cover all the important works based on classical image processing and machine learning. Adegun and

It consists of a central node labeled "DL-based Skin Lesion Segmentation" connected to five main branches: "Input Data," "Model Design & Training," "Evaluation," and "Future Research." Each main branch further branches out into subtopics such as "Datasets," "Synthetic Data," "Supervision," "Image Preprocessing," "Model Architecture," "Loss Functions," "Segmentation Annotation," "Inter-Annotator Agreement," and "Metrics." Each subtopic is referenced with a section number.

Viriri (2020a) reviewed the literature on DL -based skin image analysis, with an emphasis on the best-performing algorithms in the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) Skin Image Analysis Challenges 2018 (Codella et al., 2019) and 2019 (Tschandl et al., 2018; Codella et al., 2018; Combalia et al., 2019). However, since their review focused on the ISIC Challenges 2018 and 2019, it is more general as it covers both lesion classification and segmentation. Consequently, the number of papers surveyed for skin lesion segmentation by Adegun and Viriri (2020a) is almost an order of magnitude smaller than that in this review.

Main contributions. No existing survey approaches the present work in breadth or depth, as we cross-examine 177 research papers that deal with the automated segmentation of skin lesions in clinical and dermoscopic images. We analyze the works along several dimensions, including input data (datasets, preprocessing, and synthetic data generation), model design (architecture, modules, and losses), and evaluation (data annotation and evaluation metrics). We discuss these dimensions both from the viewpoint of select seminal works, and from a systematic viewpoint, examining how those choices have influenced current trends, and how their limitations should be addressed. We summarize all examined works in a comprehensive table to facilitate comparisons.

Search strategy. We searched DBLP and Arxiv Sanity Preserver for all scholarly publications: peer-reviewed journal papers, papers published in the proceedings of conferences or workshops, and non-peer-reviewed preprints from 2014 to 2022. The DBLP search query was (conv* | trans* | deep | neural | learn*) (skin | derm*) (segment* | delineat* | extract* |

localiz*) , thus restricting our search to DL -based works involving skin and segmentation. We use DBLP for our literature search because (a) it allows for customized search queries and lists, and (b) we did not find any relevant publications on other platforms (Google Scholar and PubMed) that were not indexed by DBLP. For unpublished preprints, we also searched on Arxiv Sanity Preserver using a similar query . 3 We filtered our search results to remove false positives (31 papers) and included only papers related to skin lesion segmentation. We excluded papers that focused on general skin segmentation and general skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis, acne, or certain sub-types of skin lesions). We also included unpublished preprints from arXiv, which (a) passed minimum quality checks levels and (b) had at least 10 citations, and excluded those that were clearly of low quality. In particular, papers that had one or more of the following were excluded from this survey: (a) missing quantitative results, (b) missing important sections such as Abstract or Methods, (c) conspicuously poor writing quality, and (d) no methodological contribution. This led to the filtering out of papers of visibly low quality ((a-c) criteria above; 18 papers) and those with no methodological contribution (20 papers).

The remaining text is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce the publicly available datasets and discuss preprocessing and synthetic data generation; in Section 3, we review the various network architectures used in deep segmentation models and discuss how deep models benefit from these networks. We also describe various loss functions designed either for general use or specifically for skin lesion segmentation. In Section 4, we detail segmentation evaluation techniques and measures. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss the open challenges in DL -based skin lesion segmentation and conclude our survey. A visual overview of the structure of this survey is presented in Fig. 2.

## 4.1. Segmentation Annotation

Obtaining ground-truth segmentations is paramount for the objective evaluation of segmentation algorithms. For synthetically generated images (Section 2.2), ground-truth segmentations may be known by construction, either by applying parallel transformations to the original ground-truth masks in the case of traditional data augmentation, or by training generative models to synthesize images paired with their segmentation masks.

For images obtained from real patients, however, human experts have to provide the ground-truth segmentations. Various workflows have been proposed to reconcile the conflicting goals of ease of learning, speed, accuracy, and flexibility of annotation.

<!-- page_break -->

On one end of the spectrum, the expert traces the lesion by hand, on images of the skin lesion printed on photographic paper, which are then scanned (Bogo et al., 2015). The technique is easy to learn and fast, but the printing and scanning procedure limits the accuracy, and the physical nature of the annotations makes corrections burdensome. On the other end of the spectrum, the annotation is performed on the computer, by a semi-automated procedure (Codella et al., 2019), with an initial border generated by a segmentation algorithm, which is then refined by the expert using an annotation software, by adjusting the parameters of the segmentation algorithm manually. This method is fast and easy to correct, but there might be a learning curve, and its accuracy depends on which algorithm is employed and how much the experts understand it.

By far, the commonest annotation method in the literature is somewhere in the middle, with fully manual annotations performed on a computer. The skin lesion image file may be opened either in a raster graphics editor (e.g., GNU Image Manipulation Program ( GIMP ) or Adobe Photoshop), or in a dedicated annotation software (Ferreira et al., 2012), where the expert traces the borders of the lesion using a mouse or stylus, with continuous freehand drawing, or with discrete control points connecting line segments (resulting in a polygon (Codella et al., 2019)) or smooth curve segments (e.g., cubic B-splines (Celebi et al., 2007a)). This method provides a good compromise, being easy to implement, fast, and accurate to perform, after an acceptable learning period for the annotator.


## 4.2. Inter-Annotator Agreement

Formally, dataset ground-truths can be viewed as samples of an estimator of the true label, which can never be directly observed (Smyth et al., 1995). This problem is often immaterial for classification, when annotation noise is small. However, in medical image segmentation, ground-truths su GLYPH&lt;11&gt; er from both biases (systematic deviations from the 'ideal') and significant noise (Zijdenbos et al., 1994; Chalana and Kim, 1997; Guillod et al., 2002; Grau et al., 2004; Bogo et al., 2015; Lampert et al., 2016), the latter appearing as inter-annotator (di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent experts) and intra-annotator (same expert at di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent times) variability.

In the largest study of its kind to date, Fortina et al. (2012) measured the inter-annotator variability among 12 dermatologists with varying levels of experience on a set of 77 dermoscopic images, showing that the average pairwise XOR dissimilarity (Section 4.3) between annotators was GLYPH&lt;25&gt; 15%, and that in 10% of cases, this value was &gt; 28%. They found more agreement among more experienced dermatologists than less experienced ones. Also, more experienced dermatologists tend to outline tighter borders than less experienced ones. They suggest that the level of agreement among experienced dermatologists could serve as an upper bound for the accuracy achievable by a segmentation algorithm, i.e., if even highly experienced dermatologists disagree on how to classify 10% of an image, it might be unreasonable to expect a segmentation algorithm to agree with more than 90% of any given ground-truth on the same image (Fortina et al., 2012).

Due to the aforementioned variability issues, whenever possible, skin lesion segmentation should be evaluated against multiple expert ground-truths, a good algorithm being one that agrees with the ground-truths at least as well as the expert agree among themselves (Chalana and Kim, 1997). Due to the cost of annotation, however, algorithms are often evaluated against a single ground-truth.

When multiple ground-truths are available, the critical issue is how to employ them. Several approaches have been proposed:

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Preferring one of the annotations (e.g., the one by the most experienced expert) and ignoring the others (Celebi et al., 2007a).

<!-- page_break -->

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Measuring and reporting the results for each annotator separately (Celebi et al., 2008), which might require non-trivial multivariate analyses if the aim is to rank the algorithms.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Measuring each automated segmentation against all corresponding ground-truths and reporting the average result (Schaefer et al., 2011).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Measuring each automated segmentation against an ensemble ground-truth formed by combining the corresponding groundtruths pixel-wise using a bitwise OR (Garnavi et al., 2011a; Garnavi and Aldeen, 2011), bitwise AND (Garnavi et al., 2011b), or a majority voting (Iyatomi et al., 2006, 2008; Norton et al., 2012).

The ground-truth ensembling process can be generalized using a thresholded probability map (Biancardi et al., 2010). First, all ground-truths for a sample are averaged pixel-wise into a probability map . Then the map is binarized, with the lesion corresponding to pixels greater than or equal to a chosen threshold. The operations of OR AND , , and majority voting, correspond, respectively to thresholds of 1 = n , 1, and ( n GLYPH&lt;0&gt; " = ) 2 n , with n being the number of ground-truths, and " being a small positive constant. AND and OR correspond, respectively, to the tightest and loosest possible contours, with other thresholds leading to intermediate results. While the optimal threshold value is data-dependent, large thresholds focus the evaluation on unambiguous regions, leading to overly optimistic evaluations of segmentation quality (Smyth et al., 1995; Lampert et al., 2016).

The abovementioned approaches fail to consider the di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erences of experience or performance of the annotators (Warfield and Wells, 2004). More elaborate ground-truth fusion alternatives include shape averaging (Rohlfing and Maurer, 2006), border averaging (Chen and Parent, 1989; Chalana and Kim, 1997), binary label fusion algorithms such as STAPLE (Warfield and Wells, 2004), TESD (Biancardi et al., 2010), and SIMPLE (Langerak et al., 2010), as well as other more recent algorithms (Peng and Li, 2013; Peng et al., 2016, 2017a).

STAPLE (Simultaneous Truth And Performance Level Estimation) has been very influential in medical image segmentation evaluation, inspiring many variants. For each image and its ground-truth segmentations, STAPLE estimates a probabilistic true segmentation through the optimal combination of individual ground-truths, weighting each one by the estimated sensitivity and specificity of its annotator. STAPLE may fail when there are only a few annotators or when their performances vary too much (Langerak et al., 2010; Lampert et al., 2016), a situation addressed by SIMPLE (Selective and Iterative Method for Performance Level Estimation) (Langerak et al., 2010) by iteratively discarding poor quality ground-truths.

Instead of attempting to fuse multiple ground-truths into a single one before employing conventional evaluation metrics, the metrics themselves may be modified to take into account annotation variability. Celebi et al. (2009c) proposed the normalized probabilistic rand index ( NPRI ) (Unnikrishnan et al., 2007), a generalization of the rand index (Rand, 1971). It penalizes segmentation results more (less) in regions where the ground-truths agree (disagree). Fig. 9 illustrates the idea: ground-truths outlined by three experienced dermatologists appear in red, green, and blue, while the automated result appears in black. NPRI does not penalize the automated segmentation in the upper part of the image, where the blue border seriously disagrees with the other two (Celebi et al., 2009c). Despite its many desirable qualities, NPRI has a subtle flaw: it is non-monotonic with the fraction of misclassified pixels (Peserico and Silletti, 2010). Consequently, this index might be unsuitable for comparing poor segmentation algorithms.

Note how annotator preferences can a GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ect the manual segmentations, e.g., smooth lesion borders (green), jagged lesion borders (black), oversegmented lesion (blue), etc. Figure taken from Celebi et al.

picture_counter_23 The image shows a close-up of a skin lesion with multiple colored contour lines overlaid on it. The lesion appears dark and irregularly shaped, with the contour lines in blue, green, red, and black outlining different aspects or boundaries of the lesion. This likely represents the application of artificial intelligence techniques in segmenting or analyzing the lesion for diagnostic purposes.


## 4.3. Evaluation Metrics

We can frame the skin lesion segmentation problem as a binary pixel-wise classification task, where the positive and negative classes correspond to the lesion and the background skin, respectively. Suppose that we have an input image and its corresponding segmentations: an automated segmentation ( AS ) produced by a segmentation algorithm and a manual segmentation ( MS ) outlined by a human expert. We can formulate a number of quantitative segmentation evaluation measures based on the concepts of true positive , false negative , false positive , and true negative , whose definitions are given in Table 2. In this table, actual and detected pixels refer to any given pixel in the MS and the corresponding pixel in the AS , respectively.

Table 2: Definitions of true positive, false negative, false positive, and true negative pixels in the context of skin lesion segmentation.


## Detected Pixel

|        |                         | Lesion ( + )   | Background ( GLYPH<0> )   |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Actual | Lesion ( + )            | True Positive  | False Negative            |
| Pixel  | Background ( GLYPH<0> ) | False Positive | True Negative             |

For a given pair of automated and manual segmentations, we can construct a 2 GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 2 confusion matrix (aka a contingency table (Pearson, 1904; Miller and Nicely, 1955)) C = GLYPH&lt;16&gt; TP FN FP TN GLYPH&lt;17&gt; , where TP FN FP , , , and TN denote the numbers of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives, respectively. Clearly, we have N = TP + FN + FP + TN , where N is the number of pixels in either image. Based on these quantities, we can define a variety of scalar similarity measures to quantify the accuracy of segmentation (Baldi et al., 2000; Japkowicz and Shah, 2011; Taha and Hanbury, 2015):

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Sensitivity ( SE ) and Specificity ( SP ) (Kahn, 1942; Yerushalmy, 1947; Binney et al., 2021): SE = TP TP + FN &amp; SP = TN TN + FP
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Precision ( PR ) and Recall ( RE ) (Kent et al., 1955): PR = TP TP + FP &amp; RE = TP TP + FN
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Accuracy ( AC ) = TP + TN TP + FN + FP + TN

<!-- page_break -->

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; F-measure ( F ) (van Rijsbergen, 1979) = 2 j AS \ MS j j AS j + j MS j = 2 GLYPH&lt;1&gt; PR GLYPH&lt;1&gt; RE PR + RE = 2 TP 2 TP + FP + FN
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; G-mean ( GM ) (Kubat et al., 1998) = p SE GLYPH&lt;1&gt; SP
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Balanced Accuracy ( BA ) (Chou and Fasman, 1978) = SE + SP 2
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Jaccard index ( J ) (Jaccard, 1901) = j AS \ MS j j AS [ MS j = TP TP + FN + FP
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Matthews Correlation Coe GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient ( MCC ) (Matthews, 1975) = TP GLYPH&lt;1&gt; TN GLYPH&lt;0&gt; FP GLYPH&lt;1&gt; FN p ( TP + FP )( TP + FN )( TN + FP )( TN + FN )

For each similarity measure, the higher the value, the better the segmentation. Except for MCC , all of these measures have a unit range, that is, [0 ; 1]. The [ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 1] range of ; MCC can be mapped to [0 1] by adding one to it and then dividing by two. Each of ; these unit-range similarity measures can then be converted to a unit-range dissimilarity measure by subtracting it from one. Note that there are also dissimilarity measures with no corresponding similarity formulation. A prime example is the well-known XOR measure (Hance et al., 1996) defined as follows:

$$X O R = \frac { | A S \oplus M S | } { | M S | } = \frac { | ( A S \cup M S ) - ( A S \cap M S ) | } { | M S | } = \frac { F P + F N } { T P + F N }.$$

It is essential to notice that di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent evaluation measures capture di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent aspects of a segmentation algorithm's performance on a given dataset, and thus there is no universally applicable evaluation measure (Japkowicz and Shah, 2011). This is why most studies employ multiple evaluation measures in an e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ort to perform a comprehensive performance evaluation. Such a strategy, however, complicates algorithm comparisons, unless one algorithm completely dominates the others with respect to all adopted evaluation measures.

Based on their observation that experts tend to avoid missing parts of the lesion in their manual borders, Garnavi et al. (2011a) argue that true positives have the highest importance in the segmentation of skin lesion images. The authors also assert that false positives (background pixels incorrectly identified as part of the lesion) are less important than false negatives (lesion pixels incorrectly identified as part of the background). Accordingly, they assign a weight of 1 5 to : TP to signify its overall importance. Furthermore, in measures that involve both FN and FP (e.g., AC F , , and XOR ), they assign a weight of 0.5 to FP to emphasize its importance over FN . Using these weights, they construct a weighted performance index , which is an arithmetic average of six commonly used measures, namely SE SP PR AC F , , , , , and (unit complement of) XOR . This scalar evaluation measure facilitates comparisons among algorithms.

In a follow-up study, Garnavi and Aldeen (2011) parameterize the weights of TP FN FP , , , and TN in their weighted performance index and then use a constrained non-linear program to determine the optimal weights. They conduct experiments with five segmentation algorithms on 55 dermoscopic images. They conclude that the optimized weights not only lead to automated algorithms that are more accurate against manual segmentations, but also diminish the di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erences among those algorithms.

We make the following key observations about the popular evaluation metrics and how they have been used in the skin lesion segmentation literature:

<!-- page_break -->

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Historically, AC has been the most popular evaluation measure owing to its simple and intuitive formulation. However, this measure tends to favor the majority class, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates in class-imbalanced domains. This drawback prompted the development of more elaborate performance evaluation measures, including GM BA , , and MCC .
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; SE and SP are especially popular in medical domains, tracing their usage in serologic test reports in the early 1900s (Binney et al., 2021). SE (aka True Positive Rate ) quantifies the accuracy on the positive class, whereas SP (aka True Negative Rate ) quantifies the accuracy on the negative class. These measures are generally used together because it is otherwise trivial to maximize one at the expense of the other (an automated border enclosing the corresponding manual border will attain a perfect SE , whereas in the opposite case, we will have a perfect SP ). Unlike AC , they are suitable for class-imbalanced domains. BA and GM combine these measures into a single evaluation measure through arithmetic and geometric averaging, respectively. Unlike AC , these composite measures are suitable for class-imbalanced domains (Luque et al., 2020).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; PR is the proportion of examples assigned to the positive class that actually belongs to the positive class. RE is equivalent to SE PR . and RE are typically used in information retrieval applications, where the focus is solely on relevant documents (positive class). F combines these measures into a single evaluation measure through harmonic averaging. This composite measure, however, is unsuitable for class-imbalanced domains (Zou et al., 2004; Chicco and Jurman, 2020; Luque et al., 2020).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; MCC is equivalent to the phi coe GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient , which is simply the Pearson correlation coe GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient applied to binary data (Chicco and Jurman, 2020). MCC values fall within the range of [ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 1] with ; GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 and 1 indicating perfect misclassification and perfect classification, respectively, while 0 indicating a classification no better than random (Matthews, 1975). Although it is biased to a certain extent (Luque et al., 2020; Zhu, 2020), this measure appears to be suitable for class-imbalanced domains (Boughorbel et al., 2017; Chicco and Jurman, 2020; Luque et al., 2020).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; J (aka Intersection over Union (Jaccard, 1912)) and F (aka Dice coe GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient aka Sørensen-Dice coe GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient (Dice, 1945; Sørensen, 1948)) are highly popular in medical image segmentation (Crum et al., 2006). These measures are monotonically related as follows: J = F = (2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; F ) and F = 2 J = (1 + J ). Thus, it makes little sense to use them together. There are two major di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erences between these measures: (i) (1 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; J ) is a proper distance metric, whereas (1 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; F ) is not (it violates the triangle inequality). (ii) It can be shown (Zijdenbos et al., 1994) that if TN is su GLYPH&lt;14&gt; ciently large compared to TP FN , , and FP , which is common in skin lesion segmentation, F becomes equivalent to Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960), which is a chance-corrected measure of inter-observer agreement.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Among the seven composite evaluation measures given above, AC GM BA , , , and MCC are symmetric, that is, they are invariant to class swapping, while F J , , and XOR are asymmetric.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; XOR is similar to False Negative Rate , that is, the unit complement of SE , with the exception that XOR has an extra additive TN term in its numerator. While XOR values are guaranteed to be nonnegative, they do not have a fixed upper bound, which makes aggregations of this measure di GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cult. XOR is also biased against small lesions (Celebi et al., 2009c). Nevertheless, owing to its intuitive formulation, XOR was popular in skin lesion segmentation until about 2015 (Celebi et al., 2015b).

<!-- page_break -->

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; The 2016 and 2017 ISIC Challenges (Gutman et al., 2016; Codella et al., 2018) adopted five measures: AC SE SP F , , , , and J , with the participants ranked based on the last measure. The 2018 ISIC Challenge (Codella et al., 2019) featured a thresholded Jaccard index , which returns the same value as the original J if the value is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold and zero otherwise. Essentially, this modified index considers automated segmentations yielding J values below the threshold as complete failures. The challenge organizers set the threshold equal to 0 65 based on an earlier study (Codella et al., 2017) : that determined the average pairwise J similarities among the manual segmentations outlined by three expert dermatologists. Since the majority of papers in this survey (168 out of 177 papers) use the ISIC datasets (Fig. 3), we list the J for all the papers in Table 3 wherever it has been reported in the corresponding papers. For papers that did not report J and instead reported F , we list the computed J based on F and denote it with an asterisk.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Some of the aforementioned measures (i.e., GM and BA ) have not been used in a skin lesion segmentation study yet.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; The evaluation measures discussed above are all region-based and thus fairly insensitive to border irregularities (Lee et al., 2003), i.e., indentations, and protrusions along the border. Boundary-based evaluation measures (Taha and Hanbury, 2015) have not been used in the skin lesion segmentation literature much except for the symmetric Hausdor GLYPH&lt;11&gt; metric (Silveira et al., 2009), which is known to be sensitive to noise (Huttenlocher et al., 1993) and biased in favor of small lesions (Bogo et al., 2015).


## 5. Discussion and Future Research

In this paper, we presented an overview of DL -based skin lesion segmentation algorithms. A lot of work has been done in this field since the first application of CNN s on these images in 2015 (Codella et al., 2015). In fact, the number of skin lesion segmentation papers published over the past 8 years (2015-2022) is more than thrice those published over the previous 17 years (1998-2014) (Celebi et al., 2015b).

However, despite the large body of work, skin lesion segmentation remains an open problem, as evidenced by the ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Segmentation Live Leaderboard (ISIC, 2018). The live leaderboard has been open and accepting submissions since 2018, and even after the permitted usage of external data, the best thresholded Jaccard index (the metric used to rank submissions) is 83 6%. Additionally, the release of the : HAM10000 lesion segmentations (Tschandl et al., 2020; ViDIR Dataverse, 2020) in 2020 shows that progressively larger skin lesion segmentation datasets continue to be released. We believe that the following aspects of skin lesion segmentation via deep learning are worthy of future work:

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Mobile dermoscopic image analysis: With the availability of various inexpensive dermoscopes designed for smartphones, mobile dermoscopic image analysis is of great interest worldwide, especially in regions where access to dermatologists is limited. Typical DL -based image segmentation algorithms have millions of weights. In addition, classical CNN architectures are known to exhibit di GLYPH&lt;14&gt; culty dealing with certain image distortions such as noise and blur (Dodge and Karam, 2016), and DL-based skin lesion diagnosis models have been demonstrated to be susceptible to similar artifacts: various kinds of noise and blur, brightness and contrast changes, dark corners (Maron et al., 2021b), bubbles, rulers, ink markings, etc. (Katsch

<!-- page_break -->

et al., 2022). Therefore, the current dermoscopic image segmentation algorithms may not be ideal for execution on typically resource-constrained mobile and edge devices, needed for patient privacy so that uploading skin images to remote servers is avoided. Leaner DL architectures, e.g., MobileNet (Howard et al., 2019), Shu GLYPH&lt;15&gt; eNet (Zhang et al., 2018), E GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cientNet (Tan and Le, 2019), MnasNet (Tan et al., 2019a), and UNeXt (Valanarasu and Patel, 2022), should be investigated in addition to the robustness of such architectures with respect to image noise and blur.

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Datasets: To train more accurate and robust deep neural segmentation architectures, we need larger, more diverse, and more representative skin lesion datasets with multiple manual segmentations per image. Additionally, as mentioned in Section 2.1, several skin lesion image classification datasets do not have the corresponding lesion mask annotations, and given their popularity in skin image analysis tasks, they may be good targets for manual delineations. For example, the PAD-UFES-20 dataset (Pacheco et al., 2020) consists of clinical images of skin lesions captured using smartphones, and obtaining groundtruth segmentations on this dataset would help advance skin image analysis on mobile devices. Additionally, a recent study conducted by Daneshjou et al. (2021a) found that as little as 10% of the AI-based studies for dermatological diagnosis included skin tone information for at least one dataset used, and that several studies included little to no images of darker skin tones, underlining the need to curate datasets with diverse skin tones.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Collecting segmentation annotations: At the time of this writing, the ISIC Archive contains over 71 000 publicly available ; images. Considering that the largest public dermoscopic image set contained a little over 1 ; 000 images about six years ago, we have come a long way. The more pressing problem now is the lack of manual segmentations for most of these images. Since manual segmentation by medical experts is laborious and costly, crowdsourcing techniques (Kovashka et al., 2016) could be explored to collect annotations from non-experts. Experts could then revise these initial annotations, or methods that tackle the problem of annotation noise (Mirikharaji et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021a) could be explored. Note that the utility of crowdsourcing in medical image annotation has been demonstrated in multiple studies (FoncubiertaRodriguez and Muller, 2012; Gurari et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2017; Goel et al., 2020). Additionally, keeping in mind the time-consuming nature of manual supervised annotation, an alternative is to use weakly-supervised annotation, e.g., bounding-box annotations (Dai et al., 2015; Papandreou et al., 2015), which are much less time-consuming to collect. For example, for several large skin lesion image datasets that do not have any lesion mask annotations (see Section 2.1), boundingbox lesion annotations can be obtained more easily than dense pixel-level segmentation annotations. In addition, weaklysupervised annotation (Bearman et al., 2016; Tajbakhsh et al., 2020b; Roth et al., 2021; En and Guo, 2022) is more amenable to crowdsourcing (Maier-Hein et al., 2014; Rajchl et al., 2016; Papadopoulos et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2019), especially for non-experts.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Handling multiple annotations per image: If the skin lesion image dataset at hand contains multiple manual segmentations per image, one should consider either using an algorithm such as STAPLE (Warfield and Wells, 2004) for fusing the manual segmentations (see Section 4), or relying on learning-based approaches, either through variants of STAPLE adapted for DL -based segmentation (Kats et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020b), or other methods (Mirikharaji et al., 2021; Lemay et al., 2022). Such a fusion algorithm can also be used to build an ensemble of multiple automated segmentations.

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Supervised segmentation evaluation measures: Supervised segmentation evaluation measures popular in the skin image analysis literature (see Section 4.3) are often region-based, pair-counting measures. Other region-based measures, such as information-theoretic measures (e.g., mutual information, variation of information, etc.) as well as boundary-based measures e.g., Hausdor GLYPH&lt;11&gt; distance (Taha and Hanbury, 2015) should be explored as well.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Unsupervised segmentation and unsupervised segmentation evaluation: Current DL -based skin lesion segmentation algorithms are mostly based on supervised learning, as shown in a supervision-level breakdown of the surveyed works (Fig. 5), meaning that these algorithms require manual segmentations for training segmentation prediction models. Nearly all of these segmentation studies employ supervised segmentation evaluation, meaning that they also require manual segmentations for testing. Due to the scarcity of annotated skin lesion images, it may be beneficial to investigate unsupervised DL (Ji et al., 2019) as well as unsupervised segmentation evaluation (Chabrier et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Systematic evaluations: Systematic evaluations that have been performed for skin lesion classification (Valle et al., 2020; Bissoto et al., 2021; Perez et al., 2018) are, so far, nonexistent in the skin lesion segmentation literature. For example, statistical significance analysis are conducted on the results of a few prior studies in skin lesion segmentation, e.g., Fortina et al. (2012).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Fusion of hand-crafted and deep features: Can we integrate the deep features extracted by DL models and hand-crafted features synergistically? For example, exploration of shape and appearance priors of skin lesions that may be beneficial to incorporate, via loss terms (Nosrati and Hamarneh, 2016; El Jurdi et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021), in deep learning models for skin lesion segmentation, similar to star-shape (Mirikharaji and Hamarneh, 2018) and boundary priors (Wang et al., 2021a).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Loss of spatial resolution: The use of repeated subsampling in CNN s leads to coarse segmentations. Various approaches have been proposed to minimize the loss of spatial resolution, including fractionally-strided convolution (or deconvolution) (Long et al., 2015), atrous (or dilated) convolution (Chen et al., 2017a), and conditional random fields (Krahenbuhl and Koltun, 2011). More research needs to be conducted to determine appropriate strategies for skin lesion segmentation that e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ectively minimize or avoid the loss of spatial resolution.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Hyperparameter tuning: Compared to traditional machine learning classifiers (e.g., nearest neighbors, decision trees, and support vector machines), deep neural networks have a large number of hyperparameters related to their architecture, optimization, and regularization. An average CNN classifier has about a dozen or more hyperparameters (Bengio, 2012) and tuning these hyperparameters systematically is a laborious undertaking. Neural architecture search is an active area of research (Elsken et al., 2019), and some of these model selection approaches have already been applied to semantic segmentation (Liu et al., 2019a) and medical image segmentation (Weng et al., 2019).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Reproducibility of results: Kapoor and Narayanan (2022) define research in ML-based science to be reproducible if the associated datasets and the code are publicly available and if there are no problems with the data analysis, where problems include the lack of well-defined training and testing partitions of the dataset, leakage across dataset partitions, features selection using the entire dataset instead of only the training partition, etc. Since several skin lesion segmentation datasets

"Clinical" is represented by cyan bars, and "Dermoscopy" is represented by dark blue bars. The dataset size for "Dermoscopy" significantly increases in 2020, reaching over 10,000, while "Clinical" remains relatively small throughout the years.

come with standardized partitions (Table 1), sharing of the code can lead to more reproducible research (Colliot et al., 2022), with the added benefit to researchers who release their code to be cited significantly more (Vandewalle, 2012). In our analysis, we found that only 38 of the 177 surveyed papers (21 47%) had publicly accessible code (Table 3), a proportion similar to a : smaller-scale analysis by Renard et al. (2020) for medical image segmentation. Another potential assessment of a method's generalization performance is its evaluation on a common held-out test set, where the ground truth segmentation masks are private, and users submit their test predictions to receive a performance assessment. For example, the ISIC 2018 dataset's test partition is available through a live leaderboard (ISIC, 2018), but it is rarely used. We found that out of 71 papers published in 2021 and 2022 included in this survey, 36 papers reported results on the ISIC 2018 dataset, but only 1 paper (Saini et al., 2021) used the online submission platform for evaluation.

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Research on clinical images: Another limitation is the limited number of benchmark datasets of clinical skin lesion images with expert pixel-level annotations. Fig. 10 shows that while the number of dermoscopic image datasets with ground-truth segmentation masks has been increasing over the last few years, only a few datasets with clinical images are available. In contrast to dermoscopic images requiring a special tool that is not always utilized even by dermatologists (Engasser and Warshaw, 2010), clinical images captured by digital cameras or smartphones have the advantage of easy accessibility, which can be utilized to evaluate the priority of patients by their lesion severity level, i.e., triage patients. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3, most of the deep skin lesion segmentation models are trained and evaluated on dermoscopic images, primarily because of the lack of large-scale clinical skin lesion image segmentation datasets (Table 1), leaving the need to develop automated tools for non-specialists unmet.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Research on total body images: While there has been some research towards detecting and tracking skin lesions over time

<!-- page_break -->

in 2D wide-field images (Mirzaalian et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Korotkov et al., 2019; Soenksen et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022) and in 3D total body images (Bogo et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2022a), simultaneous segmentation of skin lesions from total body images would help with early detection of melanoma (Halpern, 2003; Hornung et al., 2021), thus improving patient outcomes.

- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; E ect on downstream tasks: End-to-end systems have been proposed for skin images analysis tasks that directly learn the final GLYPH&lt;11&gt; tasks (e.g., predicting the diagnosis (Kawahara et al., 2019) or the clinical management decisions (Abhishek et al., 2021) of skin lesions), and these approaches present a number of advantages such as computational e GLYPH&lt;14&gt; ciency and ease of optimization. On the other hand, skin lesion diagnosis pipelines have been shown to benefit from the incorporation of prior knowledge, specifically lesion segmentation masks (Yan et al., 2019). Therefore, it is worth investigating how lesion segmentation, often an intermediate step in the skin image analysis pipeline, a GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ects the downstream dermatological tasks.
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; From binary to multi-class segmentation: While the existing work in skin lesion segmentation is mainly binary segmentation, future work may explore multi-class settings. For example, automated detection and delineation of clinical dermoscopic features (e.g., globules, streaks, pigment networks) within a skin lesion may lead to superior classification performance. Further, dermoscopic feature extraction, a task in the ISIC 2016 (Gutman et al., 2016) and 2017 (Codella et al., 2018) challenges, can be formulated as a multi-class segmentation problem (Kawahara and Hamarneh, 2018). The multiclass formulation can then be addressed by DL models, and can be used either as an intermediate step for improving skin lesion diagnosis or used directly in diagnosis models for regularizing attention maps (Yan et al., 2019). Similarly, multi-class segmentation scenarios may also include multiple skin pathologies on one subject, especially in images with large fields of view, or segmentation of the skin, the lesion(s), and the background, especially in in-the-wild images with diverse backgrounds, such as those in the Fitzpatrick17k dataset (Groh et al., 2021).
- GLYPH&lt;136&gt; Transferability of models: As the majority of skin lesion datasets are from fair-skinned patients, the generalizability of deep models to populations with diverse skin complexions is questionable. With the emergence of dermatological datasets with diverse skin tones (Groh et al., 2021; Daneshjou et al., 2021b) and methods for diagnosing pathologies fairly (Bevan and Atapour-Abarghouei, 2022; Wu et al., 2022c; Pakzad et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022), it is important to assess the transferability of DL -based skin lesion segmentation models to datasets with diverse skin tones.

## Recurrence

How well a tumor will respond to treatment, remain in remission, or recur after treatment depends on the specific tumor type and location. A recurrent tumor may be a tumor that still persists after treatment, one that grows back some time after treatment destroyed it, or a new tumor that grows in the same place as the original one.

When a brain tumor is in remission, the tumor cells have stopped growing or multiplying. Periods of remission vary. In general, benign tumors recur less often than malignant ones.

Since it is impossible to predict whether or when a particular tumor may recur, lifelong monitoring with MRI or CT scans is essential for people treated for a brain tumor, even a benign lesion. Follow-up scans may be performed every 3 to 6 months or annually, depending on the type of tumor you had.

## Discussion

Distinguishing COVID-19 from normal and other classes is one of the important issues since the pandemic in 2019. The contribution of this research is to develop a framework to classify Coronavirus suspected cases as normal or COVID-19 positive cases. Different pre-processing steps have been applied to improve the performance of the classification. After that, multiplication between the original images and the associated lung masks has been applied to get the segmented lungs. The same process of multiplication has been applied between different enhanced image versions and the associated masks to get different enhanced versions of segmented datasets. All these versions are introduced to CNN models which are VGG19 and EfficientNetB0. Therefore, two different approaches have been used to train pre-trained CNN models using transfer learning. The first approach uses full chest X-ray images, while the other approach uses lung segmented images.

From the results of conducted experiments, it has been observed that the proposed framework has achieved a good performance using either full or segmented images, however the performance using full images is better than that using segmented. Moreover, it has been observed that the performance of the classification models has been improved after applying enhancement techniques.

To evaluate the proposed framework with respect to the state-of-the-art works in COVID-19, it has been compared with the related works reviewed in this research as described in Table 6. It is worth mentioning that, the comparison is not an easy task in COVID research as the pandemic broke out in the world suddenly, all Covid research used different sources of data either local, public, or combined from different databases. Some of the public datasets are collected from different other databases. Even the research that used the same public

datasets used different number of samples. Some research performed binary class classification, where others performed multi-class classification. Thus, the proposed work has been compared with others that used the same modality which is X-ray with mentioning the number of used samples and the task.

By comparing the results of the proposed framework with recent literature, it was found that the proposed framework outperforms most of the state-of-the-art works. However, 21 slightly outperforms the proposed framework. Where the accuracy and F1-score   of 21 are 96.71% and 97% respectively, the corresponding values of the proposed framework are 95% and 0.9505 respectively. Taking in consideration that   in 21 un-balanced data has been used; the number of COVID images used is 3626 where the number of normal images is 10,198 as mentioned in the manuscript.

For more validation, different classes of the datasets have been used for training the CNN models. To check the capability of the proposed framework for 4-classes classification. The dataset versions that achieved the highest binary classification have been utilized for multi-classes classification. Since the performance of all models that trained using enhanced full image versions is close to each other, therefore, these versions have been utilized for 4-classes classification. A set of 3200 X-ray images (800 of each class) have been used to train CNN models. The newly added classes are Viral Pneumonia and Lung Opacity in addition to COVID-19 and normal classes.

It was found that the best-achieved accuracy of 4-classes classification using the full image versions reached 0.935 for histeq version by EfficientNetB0. While it reached 0.93375 for both CLAHE, and complement versions using VGG19. Table 7 shows the results of the best-achieved models for 4-classes classification.


## Conclusion and future work

In this research, a framework has been developed for automatically classifying chest X-ray images as COVID-19 positive cases or normal cases. Different techniques such as histeq, CLAHE, and complement have been applied to enhance the original X-ray images and therefore, both the original and enhanced versions have been introduced to the selected CNN pre-trained models. Two pre-trained CNN models which are VGG19 and EfficientNetB0 have been used to train different versions with the last dense layer set to (2/4) according to the number of classification classes.

Two approaches have been utilized to train pre-trained CNN models which are using whole chest X-ray images and using lung segmented images with their enhanced versions. The best binary classification accuracy reached 95% for the model trained using CLAHE full images version utilizing VGG19. The best achieved accuracy for a model trained using a segmented dataset is 91% for the model trained using Histeq version utilizing VGG19. By testing the framework for 4-classes classification, it achieved promising results which reached 0.935 accuracy.

It is obvious from the results that, the proposed framework can be employed in the future to support physicians and decrease the effect of doctors' shortages in the struggle against the disease. However, extra validations are required before applying any system, as more accuracy and more careful experiments are needed when things are related to human life. In the future, the authors are willing to try the proposed model on local data.

## Material method

This section describes the dataset, the classification algorithm (CNN) used in the study, and the transfer learning architectures VGG19, VGG16, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB4 developed based on this algorithm.


## Data source

The dataset consists of a total of 2870 human brain MRI images systematically classified into four different categories: glioma, meningioma, no tumor and pituitary. The distribution of labeled images into these four classes is shown in Table 1 for   reference 17 .

| Validation data |      138 |          140 |         75 |         135 |     488 |

Glioma is the most common type of malignant brain tumor and typically occurs in glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. Meningioma is a benign type of brain tumor, but can become malignant without appropriate intervention. These classes are labeled by physicians. The size of the input images is 64 × 64. Table 1 shows the training, test and validation set discriminations by class.

## What are the symptoms?

umors can affect the brain by destroying normal issue, compressing normal tissue, or increasing ntracranial pressure. Symptoms vary depending on he tumor's type, size, and location in the brain Fig. 2). General symptoms include: T t i t (

- · headaches that tend to worsen in the morning
- · seizures
- · stumbling, dizziness, difficulty walking
- · speech problems (e.g., difficulty finding the right word)
- · vision problems, abnormal eye movements
- · weakness on one side of the body
- · increased intracranial pressure, which causes drowsiness, headaches, nausea and vomiting, sluggish responses


## Who is affected?

The American Brain Tumor Association estimates that about 40,900 people will be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in the US this year (rate of 14 per 100,000 people). Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors by at least 10 to 1, and they occur in 20% to 40% of cancer patients. The exact number of brain metastases is unknown, but it has been estimated that 98,000 to 170,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year. Unfortunately, each year about 12,690 people die of brain tumors in the US. Although brain tumors can occur at any age, they are most common in children 3 to 12 years old and in adults 40 to 70 years old.


## How is a diagnosis made?

First, the doctor will obtain your personal and family medical history and perform a complete physical examination. In addition to checking your general health, the doctor performs a neurological exam to check mental status and memory, cranial nerve function (sight, hearing, smell, tongue and facial movement), muscle strength, coordination, reflexes, and response to pain. Additional tests may include:

- · Audiometry, a hearing test performed by an audiologist, detects hearing loss due to tumors near the cochlear nerve (e.g., acoustic neuroma).
- · An endocrine evaluation measures hormone levels in your blood or urine to detect abnormal levels caused by pituitary tumors (e.g., Cushing's Disease).
- · A visual field acuity test is performed by a neuro-ophthalmologist to detect vision loss and missing areas in your field of view.
- · A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to examine cerebrospinal fluid for tumor cells, proteins, infection, and blood.

## Overview

tumor (also called a neoplasm or lesion) is bnormal tissue that grows by uncontrolled cell ivision. Normal cells grow in a controlled manner s new cells replace old or damaged ones. For easons not fully understood, tumor cells reproduce ncontrollably. A a d a r u

Brain tumors are named after the cell type from which they grow. They may be primary (starting in the brain) or secondary (spreading to the brain from another area). Treatment options vary depending on the tumor type, size and location; whether the tumor has spread; and the age and medical health of the person. Treatment options may be curative or focus on relieving symptoms. Of the more than 120 types of brain tumors, many can be successfully treated. New therapies are improving the life span and quality of life for many people.


## What is a brain tumor?

hat starts in the brain and usually does not spread o other parts of the body. Primary brain tumors A primary brain tumor is an abnormal growth t t may be benign or malignant.

A benign brain tumor grows slowly, has distinct boundaries, and rarely spreads. Although its cells are not malignant, this tumor composed of benign cells and located in vital areas can be considered life-threatening.

A malignant brain tumor grows quickly, has irregular boundaries, and spreads to nearby brain areas. Although they are sometimes called brain cancer, malignant brain tumors do not fit the definition of cancer because they do not spread to organs outside the brain and spinal cord.


## Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors begin as

cancer elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain. They form when cancer cells are carried in the blood stream to the brain. The most common cancers that spread to the brain are lung and breast.

Figure 1. Brain tumors compress and displace normal brain tissue. Increasing size, pressure and swelling cause neurologic symptoms.

picture_counter_2 no image summary

Whether a brain tumor is benign, malignant, or metastatic, all are potentially life-threatening. Enclosed within the bony skull, the brain cannot expand to make room for a growing mass. As a result, the tumor compresses and displaces normal brain tissue (Fig. 1). Some brain tumors cause a blockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that flows around and through the brain. This blockage increases intracranial pressure and can enlarge the ventricles (hydrocephalus). Some brain tumors cause swelling (edema). Size, pressure, and swelling all create "mass effect," which cause many of the symptoms.

## 3.2. Loss Functions

A segmentation model f may be formalized as a function ˆ y = f GLYPH&lt;18&gt; ( x ), which maps an input image x to an estimated segmentation map ˆ parameterized by a (large) set of parameters y GLYPH&lt;18&gt; . For skin lesions, ˆ is a binary mask separating the lesion from the surrounding y skin. Given a training set of images xi and their corresponding ground-truth masks yi f ( xi ; yi ); i = 1 ; :::; N g , training a segmentation model consists of finding the model parameters GLYPH&lt;18&gt; that maximize the likelihood of observing those data:

$$\theta ^ { * } = \arg \max _ { \theta } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \log P ( y _ { i } | x _ { i } ; \theta ),$$

which is performed indirectly, via the minimization of a loss function between the estimated and the true segmentation masks:

$$\theta ^ { * } = \arg \min _ { \theta } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \mathcal { L } ( \hat { y } _ { i } | y _ { i } ) = \arg \min _ { \theta } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \mathcal { L } ( f _ { \theta } ( x _ { i } ) | y _ { i } ).$$

The choice of the loss function is thus critical, as it encodes not only the main optimization objective, but also much of the prior

<!-- page_break -->

Fig. 8: The distribution of loss functions used by the surveyed works in DL -based skin lesion segmentation. Cross-entropy loss is the most popular loss function (96 papers), followed by Dice (53 papers) and Jaccard (19 papers) losses. Of the 177 surveyed papers, 65 use a combination of losses, with CE + Dice (27 papers) and CE + Jaccard (11 papers) being the most popular combinations.

picture_counter_22 The image is a pie chart depicting the distribution of different loss functions used in a study. The loss functions and their respective percentages are as follows: CE (41.2%), Dice (22.7%), Jaccard (8.2%), DS (5.6%), L1 (4.3%), Focal (3.9%), Adversarial (3.0%), Tanimoto (3.0%), Tversky (2.1%), L2 (2.1%).

information needed to guide the learning and constrain the search space. As can been in Table 3, many skin lesion segmentation models employ a combination of losses to enhance generalization.


## 3.2.1. Losses based on p-norms

Losses based on p -norms are the simplest ones, and comprise the mean squared error ( MSE ) (for p = 2) and the mean absolute error ( MAE ) (for p = 1).

$$M S E ( X, Y ; \theta ) = - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \| y _ { i } - \hat { y } _ { i } \| _ { 2 },$$

$$\text{MAE} ( X, Y ; \theta ) = - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \| y _ { i } - \hat { y } _ { i } \| _ { 1 }.$$

In GAN s, to regularize the segmentations produced by the generator, it is common to utilize hybrid losses containing MSE ( ' 2 loss) (Peng et al., 2019) or MAE ( ' 1 loss) (Peng et al., 2019; Tu et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2020). The MSE has also been used as a regularizer to match attention and ground-truth maps (Xie et al., 2020a).


## 3.2.2. Cross-entropy Loss

Semantic segmentation may be viewed as classification at the pixel level, i.e., as assigning a class label to each pixel. From this perspective, minimizing the negative log-likelihoods of pixel-wise predictions (i.e., maximizing their likelihood) may be achieved

<!-- page_break -->

by minimizing a cross-entropy loss L ce :

$$\mathcal { L } _ { c e } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \sum _ { p \in \Omega _ { i } } y _ { i p } \log \hat { y } _ { i p } + ( 1 - y _ { i p } ) \log ( 1 - \hat { y } _ { i p } ), \ \hat { y } _ { i p } = P ( y _ { i p } = 1 | X ( i ) ; \theta ),$$

where GLYPH&lt;10&gt; i is the set of all image i pixels, P is the probability, xip is p th image pixel in i th image and, yip 2 f 0 1 ; g and ˆ yip 2 [0 ; 1] are respectively the true and the predicted labels of xip . The cross-entropy loss appears in the majority of deep skin lesion segmentation works, e.g., Song et al. (2019), Singh et al. (2019), and Zhang et al. (2019a).

Since the gradient of the cross-entropy loss function is inversely proportional to the predicted probabilities, hard-to-predict samples are weighted more in the parameter update equations, leading to faster convergence. A variant, the weighted crossentropy loss, penalizes pixels and class labels di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erently. Nasr-Esfahani et al. (2019) used pixel weights inversely proportional to their distance to lesion boundaries to enforce sharper boundaries. Class weighting may also mitigate the class imbalance, which, left uncorrected, tends to bias models towards the background class, since lesions tend to occupy a relatively small portion of images. Chen et al. (2018b), Goyal et al. (2019a), and Wang et al. (2019b) apply such a correction, using class weights inversely proportional to the class pixel frequency. Mirikharaji et al. (2019) weighted the pixels according to annotation noise estimated using a set of cleanly annotated data. All the aforementioned losses treat pixels independently without enforcing spatial coherence, which motivates their combination with other consistency-seeking losses.


## 3.2.3. Dice and Jaccard Loss

The Dice score and the Jaccard index are two popular metrics for segmentation evaluation (Section 4.3), measuring the overlap between predicted segmentation and ground-truth. Models may employ di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erentiable approximations of these metrics, known as soft Dice (He et al., 2017; Kaul et al., 2019; He et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a) and soft Jaccard (Venkatesh et al., 2018; Hasan et al., 2020; Sarker et al., 2019) to optimize an objective directly related to the evaluation metric.

For two classes, these losses are defined as follows:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { d i c e } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = 1 - \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \frac { 2 \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } \hat { y } _ { i p } } { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } + \hat { y } _ { i p } },$$

$$\mathcal { L } _ { j a c c } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = 1 - \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \frac { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } \hat { y } _ { i p } } { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } + \hat { y } _ { i p } - y _ { i p } \hat { y } _ { i p } }.$$

Di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent variations of overlap-based loss functions address the class imbalance problem in medical image segmentation tasks. The Tanimoto distance loss, L td is a modified Jaccard loss optimized in some models (Canalini et al., 2019; Baghersalimi et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017):

$$\mathcal { L } _ { t d } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = 1 - \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \frac { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } \hat { y } _ { i p } } { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } ^ { 2 } + \hat { y } _ { i p } ^ { 2 } - y _ { i p } \hat { y } _ { i p } },$$

which is equivalent to the Jaccard loss when both yip and ˆ yip are binary.

The Tversky loss (Abraham and Khan, 2019), inspired by the Tversky index, is another Jaccard variant that penalizes false

<!-- page_break -->

positives and false negatives di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erently to address the class imbalance problem:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { \nu } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = 1 - \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \frac { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } \hat { y } _ { i p } } { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } \hat { y } _ { i p } + \alpha y _ { i p } ( 1 - \hat { y } _ { i p } ) + \beta ( 1 - y _ { i p } ) \hat { y } _ { i p } },$$

where GLYPH&lt;11&gt; and GLYPH&lt;12&gt; tune the contributions of false negatives and false positives with GLYPH&lt;11&gt; + GLYPH&lt;12&gt; = 1.

Abraham and Khan (2019) combined the Tvserky and focal losses (Lin et al., 2017), the latter encouraging the algorithm to focus on the hard-to-predict pixels:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { f t v } = \mathcal { L } _ { t v } ^ { \frac { 1 } { \gamma } },$$

where GLYPH&lt;13&gt; controls the relative importance of the hard-to-predict samples.


## 3.2.4. Matthews Correlation Coe GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient Loss

Matthews correlation coe GLYPH&lt;14&gt; cient ( MCC ) loss is a metric-based loss function based on the correlation between predicted and ground-truth labels (Abhishek and Hamarneh, 2021). In contrast to the overlap-based losses discussed in Section 3.2.3, MCC considers misclassifying the background pixels by penalizing false negative labels, making it more e GLYPH&lt;11&gt; ective in the presence of skewed class distributions. MCC loss is defined as:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { M C C } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = 1 - \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \frac { \sum _ { p \in \Delta } \hat { y } _ { i p } y _ { i p } \frac { \sum _ { p \in \Delta } \hat { y } _ { i p } \sum _ { p \in \Delta } y _ { i p } } { M _ { i } } } { f ( \hat { y } _ { i } y _ { i } ) },$$

$$f ( \hat { y } _ { i }, y _ { i } ) = \sqrt { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } \hat { y } _ { i p } \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } - \frac { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } \hat { y } _ { i p } ( \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } ) ^ { 2 } } { M _ { i } } - \frac { ( \sum _ { p \in \Omega } \hat { y } _ { i p } ) ^ { 2 } \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } } { M _ { i } } + ( \frac { \sum _ { p \in \Omega } \hat { y } _ { i p } \sum _ { p \in \Omega } y _ { i p } } { M _ { i } } ) ^ { 2 } } \,,$$

where Mi is the total number of pixels in the image i .


## 3.2.5. Deep Supervision Loss

In DL models, the loss may apply not only to the final decision layer, but also to the intermediate hidden layers. The supervision of hidden layers, known as deep supervision, guides the learning of intermediate features. Deep supervision also addresses the vanishing gradient problem, leading to faster convergence and improves segmentation performance by constraining the feature space. Deep supervision loss appears in several skin lesion segmentation works (He et al., 2017; Zeng and Zheng, 2018; Li et al., 2018a,b; He et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Tang et al., 2019b), where it is computed in multiple layers, at di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent scales. The loss has the general form of a weighted summation of multi-scale segmentation losses:

$$\mathcal { L } _ { d s } ( X, Y ; \theta ) = \sum _ { l = 1 } ^ { m } \gamma _ { l } \mathcal { L } _ { l } ( X, Y ; \theta ),$$

where m is the number of scales, L l is the loss at the l th scale, and GLYPH&lt;13&gt; l adjusts the contribution of di GLYPH&lt;11&gt; erent losses.

## What treatments are available?

Treatment options vary depending on the type, grade, size and location of the tumor; whether it has spread; and your age and general health. The goal of treatment may be curative or focus on relieving symptoms (palliative care). Treatments are often used in combination with one another. The goal is to remove all or as much of the tumor as possible through surgery to minimize the chance of recurrence. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used to treat tumors that cannot be removed by surgery alone. For example, surgery may remove the bulk of the tumor and a small amount of residual tumor near a critical structure can later be treated with radiation.


## Observation

Sometimes the best treatment is observation. For example, benign, slow growing tumors that are small and have few symptoms may be observed with routine MRI scans every year until their growth or symptoms necessitate surgery. Observation may be the best option for older patients with other health conditions.


## Medication

Medications are used to control some of the common side effects of brain tumors.

- · Corticosteroid medications, such as dexamethasone (Decadron), are prescribed to reduce swelling and inflammation around the tumor. Because steroid medications can cause stomach ulcers and gastric reflux, famotidine (Pepcid) or pantoprazole (Protonix) are prescribed to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach.
- · Furosemide (Lasix) or mannitol (Osmitrol) may be used to control edema and intracranial pressure.
- · Anticonvulsant medications are used to prevent or control seizures. The most common ones include phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and levetiracetam (Keppra).


## Surgery

Surgery is the treatment of choice for brain tumors that can be reached without causing significant injury to vital parts of the brain (eloquent tissue). Surgery can help to refine the diagnosis, remove as much of the tumor as possible, and release pressure within the skull caused by the tumor. A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to open the

skull and remove the tumor. Sometimes only part of the tumor is removed if it is near critical areas of the brain. A partial removal can still relieve symptoms. Radiation or chemotherapy may be used on the remaining tumor cells.

Improvements in techniques, particularly imageguided surgery, intraoperative MRI/CT, and functional brain mapping have improved the surgeon's ability to precisely locate the tumor, define the tumor's borders, avoid injury to vital brain areas, and confirm the amount of tumor removal while in the operating room.

## Experimental results

This section presents the experimental results of the proposed framework to evaluate its performance and study the effect of different enhancements applied to the X-ray images on the performance of the CNN classification model.


## Experimental setup

Keras Python deep learning library on top of TensorFlow was utilized for implementing CNN models on a machine with the following specification; an   Intel  Core™ i7 CPU@ 3.6 GHz with 32 GB RAM and a Titan × ® Pascal Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Extensive experiments were carried out to obtain the best settings of the CNN models that achieve the best possible results. It is worth noting that the pre-processing for enhancing the images has been carried out using   MATLAB 18 software. ®

Both the full and segmented datasets with their enhanced versions have been used to train VGG19 and EfficientNetB0 CNN pre-trained models. The training was carried on with Adam optimizer, learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 32, and the number of epochs (10-30) epochs, SoftMax classifier. The fine-tuned pre-trained models were used for feature extraction; therefore, the weights of the pre-trained models were frozen, and they were not updated during the training to maintain ImageNet's initial weights. The top layers were fine-tuned to adjust the

The original chest X-ray images undergo various enhancements, including HE (Histogram Equalization), CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), and Complement. These enhanced images are then segmented using a mask. Both the original and segmented images are fed into two different neural networks, VGG19 and EfficientNetB0, indicating the use of transfer learning for disease diagnosis. The image includes arrows connecting each step, showing the flow of data through the process.

network according to the used chest X-ray data and to the current problem output which is (2/4) rather than 1000 in the ImageNet data. To avoid overfitting, a dropout of 0.3 was applied in the fully connected layers. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the fine-tuned top layers based on VGG19 and EfficientNetB0 respectively for binary classification.


## Performance evaluation

A benchmark dataset was employed to validate the performance of the proposed framework. For binary classification, a set of 1600 X-ray images (800 of each class) have been used to train CNN models using transfer learning. The dataset has been divided into three subsets training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used for learning the model and adjusting the parameters. The validation set is to test the model during the training phase and fine-tune the parameters. The test set is to evaluate the trained model. The division was done as 400 samples (25%) of the used X-ray images were selected randomly for testing (200 images for each class), and the remaining 75% samples were split again into training and validation splits (80-20%). For 4-classes classification, a set of 3200 X-ray images (800 of each class) have been used. Before training CNN models, different preprocessing steps were implemented to enhance the images of both full and segmented lungs chest X-ray images to investigate the classification performance of the CNN models using the different versions.

The following metrics were used for the evaluation of the different CNN models trained using various dataset versions:

$$Sensitivity/Recall(%) = \frac { T P } { T P + F N }$$

$$\text{Precision} ( \%) = \frac { T p } { T P + F P }$$

$$\text{Specificity} ( \% ) = \frac { T N } { T N + FP }$$

$$\text{Accuracy} ( \%) = \frac { T P + T N } { T P + F P + T N + F N }$$

## Results

Tables 2 and 3 show the results of training VGG19 using the original and different enhanced versions of full X-ray images and of segmented versions respectively. As it is shown in Table 2, applying different image enhancement techniques has improved the performance of the classification model. The accuracy of classification for the model trained using the original images' version was 0.913, however, it has been improved for the enhanced versions to reach 0.94, 0.95, and 0.9475 for histeq, CLAHE, and complement respectively. The detailed results including TP , TN, FP, FN, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, test accuracy, and AUC of the proposed full X-ray images using VGG19 are shown in Table 2. The performance of the model trained using the CLAHE version is the best.

Regarding the segmented versions, as it is shown in Table 3 the accuracy of classification of the model trained using the original segmented dataset version was 0.887. However, the accuracy has been improved for the enhanced segmented dataset versions to reach 0.91 using Histeq techniques, 0.9049 for CLAHE and 0.9075 for the complement version. It is clear that the accuracies using different enhanced versions are close to each other, and they are better than that of the original segmented version. The detailed results using the different metrics are shown in Table 3.

Table 4 shows the results of training EfficientNetB0 using the original and different enhanced versions of full X-ray images. The accuracy of classification using the original full images' version was 0.915, it reached 0.94, 0.938, and 0.94 for histeq, CLAHE, and complement versions respectively. The accuracies for the models trained using different enhanced versions are better than that of the original version. The detailed results using the different metrics are shown in Table 4.

Regarding the segmented versions, as shown in Table 5 the accuracy of the classification for the EfficientNetB0 model trained using the original segmented lung dataset version was 0.885. However, the accuracy has been improved to 0.905, 0.905, and 0.9075 for Histeq, CLAHE and complement versions respectively. As with VGG19, the accuracies of training EfficientNetB0 using different enhanced segmented versions are close to each other, but they are all better than that of the original segmented version. The detailed results using the different metrics are shown in Table 5.

It is clear that the performance of all enhanced versions is better than that of their associated original version using either VGG19 or EfficientNetB0 models and for both full and segmented versions. By comparing the results

of the full X-ray images and segmented images using the same CNN model, reductions in the performance of the CNN models trained using the segmented datasets rather than those trained using full-image datasets were observed. The models built using full images achieved better performance in general. The reason for that might be that the full images may have more details outside the lung region in the surroundings region that contribute to the classification and help to improve the performance.

Regarding the comparison of the used 2 CNNs models, the results of the two models are close to each other, however, the results of VGG19 are a bit better than those of EfficientNetB0. The best achieved performance is of the VGG19 model trained using the CLAHE version of full X-ray images for binary classification of chest X-ray images into COVID-19 or normal. It achieved a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.94, precision of 0.9412, F1 score of 0.9505 and accuracy of 0.95. Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10 show the training and validation accuracies, the training and validation losses, the training and test ROC curve and the confusion matrix of that best achieved model respectively.

Health is very important for human life. In particular, the health of the brain, which is the executive of the vital resource, is very important. Diagnosis for human health is provided by magnetic resonance imaging ȋMRIȌ devices, which help health decision makers in critical organs such as brain health. Images from these devices are a source of big data for artificial intelligence. This big data enables high performance in image processing classification problems, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. In this study, we aim to classify brain tumors such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor from brain MR images. Convolutional Neural Network ȋCNNȌ and CNN-based inception-V͹, EfficientNetBͺ, VGGͷͿ, transfer learning methods were used for classification. F-score, recall, imprinting and accuracy were used to evaluate these models. The best accuracy result was obtained with VGGͷͼ with Ϳ;%, while the F-score value of the same transfer learning model was Ϳͽ%, the Area Under the Curve ȋAUCȌ value was ͿͿ%, the recall value was Ϳ;%, and the precision value was Ϳ;%. CNN architecture and CNN-based transfer learning models are very important for human health in early diagnosis and rapid treatment of such diseases.

The healthcare industry has been rapidly transformed by technological advances in recent years, and an important component of this transformation is artificial intelligence (AI) technology. AI is a computer system that simulates human-like intelligence and has many applications in medicine. One such area is the fight against brain tumors. Brain tumors are a major public health problem in the healthcare sector, and accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up processes are critical. AI has become an important tool for improving these processes and has great potential for early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

Brain tumors affect human health due to their   location . AI is designed to help diagnose and treat complex 1 diseases such as brain tumors by combining technologies such as big data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning. AI has the ability to detect and classify tumors by analyzing brain imaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). AI algorithms can help determine the size, location, class, and aggressiveness of tumors. This helps physicians make a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, and helps patients better understand their health.

AI can also be used to track a patient's progress through treatment. AI-based analytics can be used to assess treatment response and predict potential tumor recurrence. In this way, patients' treatment plans can be more effectively organized and individualized treatment approaches can be developed.

In this study, difference detection was performed on brain images. Classification was performed with multilayer CNN and CNN-based transfer learning methods on 4 classes labeled by physicians.

The contribution of the study is as follows.

- · We investigate the transfer learning method with the highest performance in the classification process of transfer learning methods on brain images.
- · We investigate the performance of CNN and transfer learning on brain images using CNN as a multi-layer without using transfer learning.
- · We investigate whether it is possible to achieve good results with a skewed and poor quality dataset.

The flow diagram of the study is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. Flow diagram of the work.

picture_counter_1 The image is a diagram from a medical research paper demonstrating the use of artificial intelligence techniques in diagnosing brain tumors. It shows a flowchart with MRI images of different types of brain tumors (Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, No Tumor, Pituitary Tumor) on the left. These images are processed using various deep learning models (EfficientNetB4, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, CNN) as indicated in the central section. The output from these models undergoes several layers of processing (GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dropout with rate 0.05, Dense Layer, Optimizer using RectifiedAdam) leading to the final classification of tumor types on the right.

Studies on brain tumors in the last 5 years will be scanned from indexes such as WOS and IEEE and the details of the related studies will be explained in this section.

In a study of 3064 MRI images from 233 patients belonging to 4 different tumor classes (meningioma, glioma, pituitary, tumor) with support vector machine (SVM) on datasets generated after various preprocessing, an accuracy value between 94% was   obtained 1 .  Santhosh and colleagues presented a classification model aimed at distinguishing between normal and abnormal brain tissue. This system relied on a combination of thresholding and watershed segmentation techniques. Using SVM, the classification accuracy reached an impressive 85.32% across all   categories . Rafael et al. achieved an accuracy rate of 89.6% using SVM for brain 2 tumor   classification . Similarly, Gupta and Sasidhar achieved 87% accuracy using   SVM . Gumaei et al. proposed 3 4 a classification framework that harnesses the power of regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) for the purpose of distinguishing between benign and malignant brain tumors. Their study involved the collection and preprocessing of MRI data related to meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors. The feature selection process was performed using GIST, Normalized GIST (NGIST), and PCA-NGIST methods. Using a meticulous fivefold cross-validation procedure, the RELM technique yielded an impressive overall accuracy of 92.61% . 92% accuracy 5 was achieved using SVM machine learning on a dataset of 90 normal and 154 tumor brain   images . 3264 brain 6 tumor images from Kaggle were classified using CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM hybrid. The results obtained; CNN 89%, LSTM 90.02%, CNN-LSTM 92%   accuracy 7 . Srinivas and co-authors conducted a comprehensive study involving a comparative performance analysis of transfer learning based  CNN models pre-trained with VGG16, ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 architectures for brain tumor cell prediction. In particular, InceptionV3 had an accuracy of 78%, VGG16 had a high accuracy of 96%, and ResNet-50 had an accuracy of 95% 8 . In a CNN-based study of brain tumor images, Choudhury, Mahanty, Kumar, and Mishra achieved an accuracy of 96.08% 9 , while Martini and Oermann's CNN-based study achieved an accuracy of 93.9% 10 . Between 2005 and 2010, a study was conducted to predict the classes of meningioma, glioma, and pituitary gland from brain images of 233 patients in China. In this study, 4-layer CNN was used. The accuracy was 91.3% 11 . In a study of 200 brain tumor images, the accuracy of image segmentation was 92.14% 12 . Classification studies on 102 brain tumor patients using SVM and KNN machine learning methods achieved 85% and 88% accuracy,   respectively 13 . In a classification study of 233 brain tumor patients, SVM and KNN were used. In this study, the accuracy result was 91.28% 14 . In a classification study using CNN on 233 patient images with meningioma, glioma or pituitary tumor, the accuracy was 91.43% with fivefold cross-validation 15 . The author introduced a novel approach known as a Capsule Network (CapsNet), which effectively integrates brain MRI images and approximate tumor boundaries for the purpose of brain tumor classification. This study achieved an impressive accuracy of 90.89% in accurately classifying brain   tumors 16 . In this study, as seen in the literature, CNN and CNN-based transfer learning methods will be used for brain tumor detection.

## Classification using pre-trained convolution neural network model

In this research, different versions of either full or segmented chest X-ray images have been introduced to CNN models to train the classifiers. Different experiments have been carried out on the original and segmented lung X-ray images both with their different enhanced versions. The classification has been done using   VGG19 14 and EfficientNetB0 16 pre-trained CNN models. After the calculation of different performance metrics, the best model has been selected as the adopted model. The next subsections give a brief description of the used pre-trained models.


## VGG19 model

VGG19 is a variant of the VGG CNN model which was created by Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at Oxford University. VGG19 was one of the winners of the Image Net Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2014. The size of the input image to VGG19 is (224 × 224). VGG19 contains 16 convolution layers, 5 maxpooling layers and 3 fully connected layers. The convolution layers are with (3 × 3) filters' size, stride of 1 pixel and padding of 1 pixel. The max-pooling layers are with a size of 2 × 2 and a stride of 2. The rectification (ReLU)

activation function is utilized for all hidden layers. Then, the first 2 fully connected layers with 4096 channels each are uitilized followed by the last layer of 1000 channels to represent the different 1000 classes of the ImageNet with soft-max activation   function 15 .


## EfficientNetB0 model

Google research group designed a family of models, called EfficientNets using a scaling method and achieved better efficiency and accuracy than previous ConvNets. EfficientNet is based on scaling CNNs and reaching better performance by balancing network width, depth, and resolution. Therefore, the focus is to present a scaling method to uniformly scale the 3 dimensions with a simple highly effective compound coefficient. Thus, it can be considered as an optimization problem to find the best coefficients for depth, width, and resolution that maximizes the accuracy of the network given the constraints of the available resources. The primary building block of the EfficientNet models is MBConv. The network's dimension equation was used to get the family of neural networks EfficientNet-B0 to   B7 16 . In this research, EfficientNetB0 was used for the classification of the chest X-ray images. Figure 4 sums up the framework of the adopted methodology in this research.
