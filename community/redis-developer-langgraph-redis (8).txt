# How to add thread-level persistence with Redis (functional API)

!!! info "Prerequisites"

    This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
    
    - [Functional API](../../concepts/functional_api/)
    - [Persistence](../../concepts/persistence/)
    - [Memory](../../concepts/memory/)
    - [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/)

Many AI applications need memory to share context across multiple interactions on the same [thread](../../concepts/persistence#threads) (e.g., multiple turns of a conversation). In LangGraph functional API, this kind of memory can be added to any [entrypoint()][langgraph.func.entrypoint] workflow using [thread-level persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence).

When creating a LangGraph workflow, you can set it up to persist its results by using a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#basecheckpointsaver):


1. Create an instance of a Redis checkpointer:

    ```python
    from langgraph.checkpoint.redis import RedisSaver
    
    # Set up Redis connection for checkpointer
    REDIS_URI = "redis://redis:6379"
    checkpointer = None
    with RedisSaver.from_conn_string(REDIS_URI) as cp:
        cp.setup()
        checkpointer = cp      
    ```

2. Pass `checkpointer` instance to the `entrypoint()` decorator:

    ```python
    from langgraph.func import entrypoint
    
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def workflow(inputs)
        ...
    ```

3. Optionally expose `previous` parameter in the workflow function signature:

    ```python
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def workflow(
        inputs,
        *,
        # you can optionally specify `previous` in the workflow function signature
        # to access the return value from the workflow as of the last execution
        previous
    ):
        previous = previous or []
        combined_inputs = previous + inputs
        result = do_something(combined_inputs)
        ...
    ```

4. Optionally choose which values will be returned from the workflow and which will be saved by the checkpointer as `previous`:

    ```python
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def workflow(inputs, *, previous):
        ...
        result = do_something(...)
        return entrypoint.final(value=result, save=combine(inputs, result))
    ```

This guide shows how you can add thread-level persistence to your workflow using Redis as the backing store.

!!! tip "Note"

    If you need memory that is __shared__ across multiple conversations or users (cross-thread persistence), check out this [how-to guide](../cross-thread-persistence-functional).

## Setup

First we need to install the packages required
"""

%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

"""
Next, we need to set API key for Anthropic (the LLM we will use).

        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
# Output:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·

## Example: simple chatbot with short-term memory

We will be using a workflow with a single task that calls a [chat model](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/).

Let's first define the model we'll be using:
"""

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

"""
Now we can define our task and workflow. To add in persistence, we need to pass in a [Checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver) to the [entrypoint()][langgraph.func.entrypoint] decorator.
"""

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.checkpoint.redis import RedisSaver


@task
def call_model(messages: list[BaseMessage]):
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return response


# Set up Redis connection for checkpointer
REDIS_URI = "redis://redis:6379"
checkpointer = None
with RedisSaver.from_conn_string(REDIS_URI) as cp:
    cp.setup()
    checkpointer = cp


@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(inputs: list[BaseMessage], *, previous: list[BaseMessage]):
    if previous:
        inputs = add_messages(previous, inputs)

    response = call_model(inputs).result()
    return entrypoint.final(value=response, save=add_messages(inputs, response))

"""
If we try to use this workflow, the context of the conversation will be persisted across interactions:
"""

"""
!!! note Note

    If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you __don't need__ to pass checkpointer to the entrypoint decorator, since it's done automatically.
"""

"""
We can now interact with the agent and see that it remembers previous messages!
"""

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "hi! I'm bob"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()
# Output:
#   ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

#   

#   Hi Bob! I'm Claude. Nice to meet you! How are you today?


"""
You can always resume previous threads:
"""

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()
# Output:
#   ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

#   

#   Your name is Bob. You told me that in your first message when you said "hi! I'm bob"


"""
If we want to start a new conversation, we can pass in a different `thread_id`. Poof! All the memories are gone!
"""

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [input_message],
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    chunk.pretty_print()
# Output:
#   ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

#   

#   I don't know your name. I can only see our current conversation and don't have access to personal information unless you choose to share it with me.

!!! tip "Streaming tokens"

    If you would like to stream LLM tokens from your chatbot, you can use `stream_mode="messages"`. Check out this [how-to guide](../streaming-tokens) to learn more.
