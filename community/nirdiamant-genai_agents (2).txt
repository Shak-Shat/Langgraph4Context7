# Chiron - A Feynman-Enhanced Learning Agent Using LangGraph

## Overview
This notebook presents a structured learning agent implemented using LangGraph. The system guides learners through a sequence of defined but customizable checkpoints, verifying understanding at each step and providing Feynman-style teaching when needed.

## Motivation
In traditional educational settings, access to personalized 1:1 tutoring is often limited by cost and availability. This project aims to democratize personalized learning by creating an AI tutor that can:
- Provide individualized attention and feedback 24/7
- Use your own notes and web-retrieved content as context
- Offer patient, simple explanations of complex topics

## Key Components
1. **Learning State Graph**: Orchestrates the sequential learning workflow
2. **Checkpoint System**: Defines structured learning milestones
3. **Web Search Integration**: Dynamically retrieves relevant learning materials
4. **Context Processing**: Chunks and processes learning materials
5. **Question Generation**: Creates checkpoint-specific verification questions
6. **Understanding Verification**: Evaluates learner comprehension with a clear threshold (70%)
7. **Feynman Teaching**: Simplifies complex concepts when understanding is insufficient

## Method
The system follows a structured learning cycle:

### 1. Checkpoint Definition
- Generates sequential learning milestones with clear success criteria

### 2. Context Building
- Processes student-provided materials or retrieves relevant web content

### 3. Context Validation
- Validates context based on checkpoint criteria
- Performs additional web searches if context doesn't meet checkpoint requirements

### 4. Embedding Storage
- Stores embeddings for retrieving only relevant chunks during verification

### 5. Understanding Verification
- Generates checkpoint-specific questions
- Evaluates responses against a 70% understanding threshold
- Provides detailed feedback

### 6. Progressive Learning
- Advances to the next checkpoint when understanding is verified
- Provides Feynman-style explanations when needed

## Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates a structured approach to guided learning. By combining sequential checkpoints, clear verification thresholds, and Feynman-style teaching, it offers a methodical learning experience with immediate support when needed. The system is particularly effective for complex topics that benefit from step-by-step guidance and simplified explanations.

## Data Models Definition
In this section, we define the core data structures for our adaptive learning system using Pydantic models. These models ensure type safety and provide clear structure for:
- Learning goals and objectives
- Checkpoint definitions and tracking
- Search queries for dynamic content

- Feynman teaching output format
- Question generation

Each model is designed to capture specific aspects of the learning process while maintaining strict type validation.

note = """Anemia: A Comprehensive Overview
Definition
Anemia is a medical condition characterized by a decrease in the total number of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin in the blood. This reduction leads to a diminished ability to carry oxygen to the body's tissues, affecting overall body function and health.
Blood Components and Their Role
Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are fundamental components of blood that carry oxygen throughout the body. These cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein that gives blood its characteristic red color and is responsible for oxygen transport. The typical lifespan of a red blood cell is approximately 120 days, after which it must be replaced by new cells produced in the bone marrow.
Types of Anemia
Iron Deficiency Anemia represents the most prevalent form of anemia worldwide. It occurs due to insufficient iron intake or absorption, particularly affecting pregnant women, growing children, menstruating women, and individuals with poor nutritional intake.
Vitamin Deficiency Anemia develops when the body lacks sufficient amounts of vitamin B12 or folate (vitamin B9). This deficiency can stem from dietary inadequacies or problems with nutrient absorption in the digestive system.
Aplastic Anemia, though rare, presents a serious condition where the bone marrow fails to produce adequate blood cells. This form can be either inherited through genetic factors or acquired through various environmental causes or medical conditions.
Hemolytic Anemia occurs when red blood cells are destroyed at a rate faster than the body can replace them. This condition may be inherited through genetic factors or acquired through various external causes.
Clinical Manifestations
Anemia manifests through various symptoms including persistent fatigue and weakness. Patients often present with pale or yellowish skin, experience shortness of breath, and may suffer from dizziness. Additional symptoms include irregular heartbeat patterns, frequent headaches, cold extremities, and occasional chest pain.
Diagnostic Approach
Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination by a healthcare provider. Blood tests form the cornerstone of diagnosis, including a Complete Blood Count (CBC), assessment of iron levels, vitamin B12 measurement, and folate level determination. These tests help identify the specific type of anemia and guide appropriate treatment.
Treatment Strategies
Dietary modification serves as a fundamental treatment approach. This involves increasing consumption of iron-rich foods such as red meat, dark leafy vegetables, legumes, and iron-fortified cereals.
Supplementation often proves necessary and may include iron supplements, vitamin B12, or folic acid, depending on the underlying cause of anemia.
Medical interventions become necessary in severe cases. Blood transfusions may be required for severe anemia, while bone marrow transplantation might be considered for cases of aplastic anemia.
Preventive Measures
Prevention centers on maintaining a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, particularly iron, vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin C, which enhances iron absorption. Regular medical check-ups allow for early detection and intervention.
Certain populations require special attention regarding prevention. These include pregnant women, menstruating women, growing children, individuals following vegetarian or vegan diets, and athletes who may have increased nutritional demands.
Potential Complications
Untreated anemia can lead to several serious complications. These include severe fatigue that impacts daily activities, complications during pregnancy, cardiovascular problems, depression, and cognitive difficulties that may affect work or school performance.
Clinical Significance
Anemia often serves as an indicator of other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, early detection and appropriate treatment prove crucial for optimal outcomes. Different forms of anemia require specific treatment approaches, and regular monitoring may be necessary to ensure treatment effectiveness."""

example answer:
Anemia is a medical condition characterized by a deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells (RBCs) or a reduced amount of hemoglobin in these cells, which impairs the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the body’s tissues. In clinical practice, anemia is significant because it can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and shortness of breath, which may severely impact quality of life and, in severe cases, lead to life-threatening complications.

Types of Anemia and Their Causes
Iron Deficiency Anemia: This is the most common type of anemia, often caused by insufficient iron intake, blood loss (e.g., heavy menstruation or gastrointestinal bleeding), or poor iron absorption (due to conditions like celiac disease). Iron is essential for hemoglobin production, and a deficiency in iron leads to decreased hemoglobin levels, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues.

Vitamin B12 or Folate Deficiency Anemia: This type of anemia, sometimes called megaloblastic anemia, occurs due to a deficiency in vitamin B12, folate, or both. These vitamins are crucial for DNA synthesis in red blood cells. Causes include poor dietary intake, absorption issues (e.g., pernicious anemia, which is due to the loss of stomach cells producing intrinsic factor needed for B12 absorption), or conditions affecting the small intestine.

Hemolytic Anemia: This type of anemia is caused by the premature destruction of red blood cells, which can occur due to autoimmune diseases, genetic conditions (e.g., sickle cell disease or hereditary spherocytosis), infections, or certain medications. In hemolytic anemia, the bone marrow cannot keep up with the rapid loss of RBCs, resulting in low RBC counts and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.

Role of Hemoglobin in Diagnosing Anemia
Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that binds to oxygen and transports it throughout the body. In clinical practice, hemoglobin levels are crucial for diagnosing anemia, as low levels indicate insufficient oxygen-carrying capacity. A Complete Blood Count (CBC) test measures hemoglobin levels and provides insights into red blood cell count and size, helping identify the type and severity of anemia.

#   ======================================================================

#   

#   📚 SIMPLIFIED EXPLANATION:

#   ──────────────────────────────

#   LangGraph is like a toolkit for building smart digital

#   helpers that can talk and work together. Imagine you have a

#   group of robots, each with a different job, like one for

#   answering questions, another for finding information, and

#   another for making decisions. LangGraph helps you organize

#   these robots so they can work together smoothly, even if

#   they need to go back and forth to complete a task. It's part

#   of a bigger system called LangChain, which is like a big

#   toolbox for building these kinds of helpers. LangGraph is

#   special because it lets these robots work in loops, which

#   means they can repeat steps if needed, making them more

#   flexible and efficient.

#   

#   💡 KEY CONCEPTS:

#   ──────────────────────────────

#     1. LangGraph is a framework for organizing and managing multiple LLM agents.

#     2. It allows for the creation of cyclical graphs, enabling agents to repeat tasks as needed.

#     3. LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem, which provides tools for building intelligent agents.

#     4. It helps in coordinating complex workflows by allowing agents to communicate and work together.

#   

#   🔄 ANALOGIES & EXAMPLES:

#   ──────────────────────────────

#     1. Think of LangGraph as a conductor in an orchestra, ensuring all musicians (agents) play in harmony, even if they need to repeat parts of the music.

#     2. Imagine LangGraph as a project manager who organizes a team (agents) to work on a project, allowing them to revisit tasks if necessary to ensure everything is done correctly.

#     3. LangGraph is like a traffic controller, directing the flow of information between different agents, ensuring they can loop back if they miss something.
